       " array([{'text': 'When Your Employer Changes Your Working Hours When Your Employer Changes Your Working Hours By: Abigail Taylor - Updated: 11 Apr 2018 | *Discuss Tweet For many people working 9 to 5 is just not a reality. Clearly, businesses need to have staff working at relevant times to meet the demands of their business (e.g. for a restaurant this might be evenings and weekends). These non-traditional working hours are to be expected by those working in some professions. However this doesn\\'t mean that you lose the rights of 9-5 workers. Check Your Contract For any issue regarding your employment, it is really important to look at your contract. You should have been provided with a copy of your contract at the point when you first signed it (started your employment). If you were not provided with a copy, ask for one. If you have lost your copy, you are still entitled to see your contract which your employer should hold in your employee file. Be aware that not all employee records will be held \"onsite\" at your place of work and so such a request may take a few days. If the contract refers to any other procedures (such as disciplinary procedures) or terms and conditions of employment, this forms part of your contract and you are entitled to see these documents too. Fixed Days vs Shift Work The main difference you will usually find between fixed day and shift work (such as in restaurants) is that if you have fixed days, your contract will usually specify exactly what days and times you are expected to work; it may even tell you how long you are allowed to take for your lunch break. If you work shifts where your employer puts up a rota to tell you when you are working, your hours/days of work are usually not specified in your contract. Hours Stated in Your Contract The first thing to look at is the number of working hours stated in your contract. This is the number of hours that you are expected to work. Your employer must give you at least that number of hours. There is a precedent for employers promising full time employment but only putting a limited number of hours on your contract. Most of the time you will be given more hours as promised. However be aware that this is not a requirement - your employer only has to give you the minimum number stated on your contract. It is important when signing your contract to check that you are happy to only receive the number of hours stated in it, as that is all that you are guaranteed! Note that if you choose to \"shift-swap\" with another employee and end up with fewer hours than stated in your contract, that is your choice, and your employer is not obliged to give you additional hours to make up the deficit. I have a contract for 21 hours and my employer has just told us we are having a delivery every day Mon-Sunday for xmas. They have said if we don\\'t work these days we will be disciplined. I work Monday to Friday and they have told us we have to work Saturday and Sunday night. If we have a contract of 21 hours do we have to work over our contract hours? Can I refuse to work over my contract - I have 3 young children? You cannot be forced to work over the number of hours in your contract and may legally refuse to do so. If you do not work the full number of hours stated in your contract (without good reason such as illness/bereavement etc) then your employer may discipline you. If you object to the number of hours you have been allocated, it is always best to speak to your employer as soon as possible so they can reallocate hours. You cannot simply work Mon-Fri and then say you have done your hours so you are not working at the weekend. Your employer may choose to reduce your hours by reducing your hours during the week, and it is entirely up to them as to which shifts they remove to reduce the hours given to you. Which Shifts You Work I\\'ve been working for a company for 11 years since it started. I have been working day shifts because they told me that the night shift is too risky for ladies. Now they said I must work the night shift without any reason or agreement. I haven\\'t worked a night shift before and I have two children who are 5 & 9. My husband works nights so cannot look after them. What times/days you have to work will depend on your contract. If your contract states that you are available to work any time, unfortunately you can be called upon to work on different days/hours than your usual work pattern. If your availability has changed, you need to discuss this with your employer, and a new contract may need to be signed with this change reflected. I have been working late afternoons and evenings into the night due to the nature of my work. The place I work has very bad public transport connections and absolutely no public transport after my work finishes. Now my employer has asked me to come in early one day a week because it would suit them better. This would be really difficult for me due to transport problems. Can my employer force me to change my hours and can they give me a warning or fire me if I can\\'t accommodate them? If your contract limits your working hours/days (for example from 9am to 5pm), your employer can request that you change these hours, but cannot force you to do so. It is always worth discussing any requested changes with your employer as you may be able to agree with your employer a compromise that suits you both better. I work for a care company and work 6 days and 1 evening, I have 2 children under the age of 16. Today I was told that next week and future weeks I will be doing 4 days and 2 nights but nobody else has had this text. Can my manager do this? Really worry as I have nobody to watch my kids at nights. Clearly child care is a major concern in relation to working hours for many people and so if you have any concerns this should be discussed with your employer, as it may be that there is another employee who is more able to work evenings/nights. As explained above however, if your contract states that you can work these times, your employer may rota you to do so and require you to work these times. Flexible Working All workers have the right to request flexible working to accommodate other commitments. To have the right to request flexible working you must:a) have worked for the company for at least 26 weeksb) not have made a flexible working request already in the last 12 months However be aware that your employer does not have to agree to this. They must however give your request serious consideration and give you the reasons (in writing) for any request being denied. In some businesses, this simply isn\\'t feasible, so be reasonable and try to agree times that suit both you and your employer (for example still working some evenings, but perhaps starting at 5:30/6pm so that you can pick up your children from school and take them to a relative/friend\\'s house who will babysit for you. )Note the flexible working policy has now been extended to all workers and not just carers of children. Notice of working hours/changes Your employer must give you reasonable notice of any changes to your working hours, such as cancelling your shifts. They may request last minute changes (such as ringing you that morning to say that they do not require you to work) and you can choose to agree to this change. However if you are not given reasonable notice of your shift being cancelled/shortened, you can politely refuse this reduction in your hours. How much notice is \"reasonable\"? There is no law simply defining reasonable. However your contract may state this. In most cases, a minimum of 12 hours notice would be expected as reasonable notice to cancel a shift. It may be reasonable to have more notice of a requirement to work (rather than not work). My employer normally gives out the next week rota normally on the Thursday. It seems to be getting later and later. It is now Friday and we still haven\\'t had the rota for next week. Can they do that? It is often a problem with those who rely on a rota for their working days / hours that the rota of when you may be working is often not put up until near the end of the week before, giving you only a few days notice of any early-week shift. Unfortunately again, unless specified in your contract, the only guide is what is \"reasonable\". If this causes you problems however, ask your employer about this. Often the rota will be in draft form \"subject to minor alterations\" many weeks in advance. If you will not be in work on days to know when you are working, you can also always ring up to ask. Obviously if rotas are put up last minute across several weeks, you may need to speak to your employer. However if it is a one-off and only a day later, do be reasonable - has your manager been away ill or had another reason to not be able to put up the rota as early as normal that week? If the late notice causes you substantial problems, communicate with your Manager. Breaches of contract If your employer is in breach of your employment contract (e.g. not giving you your amount of contracted hours), what can you do? The first step is always to talk to your employer. It may be a simple mistake which can easily be rectified by amending the rota If you are unhappy with your manager\\'s response to your complaint, follow your company\\'s complaints procedure. This often requires you to forward your complaint to a more senior manager. If you do not know your employer\\'s complaints procedure, ask to see a copy of it. If your company has an HR Department, they may also be able to provide you with guidance on the procedures. You are often entitled to have a supporter present, such as another employee, which can be reassuring at any meeting. It is always best to try to resolve matters \"in house\" with your employer. If you are not able to do so, you can take your employer to an Employment Tribunal. Be aware that whilst you can\\'t be fired for doing so, this may make for an awkward working environment if you are still employed at the firm. Employment Tribunals An employment tribunal is an independent body that will assess your complaint and may make your employer pay you compensation if they think your rights have been breached. You usually have to apply to the employment tribunal within 3 months of the incident you are complaining about arising (e.g. 3 months after you were unfairly fired). To refer a matter to an employment tribunal, you must download and fill in a form which can be found at www.justice.gov.uk. There are also guidance notes online to assist you with filling in your application. The form can be filled in and submitted online, or printed and returned by post to your local employment tribunal office. If you want help in referring your complaint to an employment tribunal, you can contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau who will provide you with free advice. If you are a member of a trade union, they may also be able to assist you. Zero Hours Contracts If you are on a zero hours contract, much of the above may not apply to your circumstances.

[Add a Comment]I work in a collage campus canteen my contract is 20 hours, which I wanted as I suffer from bad anxiety and depression which I am on medication for and also disability, I am allowed work these hours and keep my medical card which I need because the medication is exspensive. I am finished now for the summer as I do the evening shift and all classes are finished but now I have been told by employer when I go back in September I will have to work 35hrs a week when my contract states 20 hours. Can they leagally do this and fire me if I don’t agree to the change of contract. I work part time because I can’t afford my medication which would cost at least 300 a month and also because I am not fit for full time work. I don’t miss days through my illness as I am able for 20 but not 35? Shell - 11-Apr-18 @ 11:12 PMMy employer are restructuring my dept, ie reducing work for certain by 50%. we have been told that we will need to go to another area of the market business but the shift patterns are very unsociable, working various days but until midnight or 1am. The only option for those of us that cannot work these hours is to leave. Is this constructive dismissal? What are my rights? Suerue - 11-Apr-18 @ 9:48 PMabout 5 years ago I made an arrangement with my company to split my working shift to fit in with my other job and so the hours wer\\'nt affecting my health. Today I was told that they were moving me to a section I cant do those same hours on. The reason for this is that the company have a problem with another employee and are using me as a scape goat to rid them of this problem! Are they allowed to cause stress to an employee by doing this. Why should I be moved to eliminate their problem with this other employee? catlover - 11-Apr-18 @ 6:05 PMmarkus - Your Question: If I have a 30 hr contract can the company I work for give me less hours or do they legally have to give me my contracted hours.

I put in for flexible working 5 years ago and they said if I withdrew my application they would strive to give me set shifts as much as possible. They kept to their word and my manager gave me set shifts every week. But now my manager has left and we have a new one. She said she is going to have to change my shifts now. What should I do? Our Response: You could make another request for flexible working. If your current arrangement of set shifts has worked well for five years, your employer may not have good business grounds for refusing what would effectively be a continuation of this.

As Xmas Eve is a Monday, the company want to make us work 8 hrs on a Sunday in exchange for the day off. I believe my contact has to specifically mention Sunday working for us to be legally obliged to do it. My contract mentions nothing of having to swap working days when business needs suit nor does it mention Sunday in my contract. I do not work in retail or a betting shop. Please can you advise.

(1 hour to and from work each day even though I only live 15 minutes from my place of work) AND 1 hour per day for a dinner break although I find it IMPOSSIBLE to complete my daily schedule if I was to take an hour break. Mrbrown - 5-Apr-18 @ 6:41 PMHi. I work for a company where I am contracted to 40 hours per week (paid breaks). As Xmas Eve is a Monday, the company want to make us work 8 hrs on a Sunday in exchange for the day off. I believe my contact has to specifically mention Sunday working for us to be legally obliged to do it. My contract mentions nothing of having to swap working days when business needs suit nor does it mention Sunday in my contract. I do not work in retail or a betting shop. Please can you advise. Thanks BJM - 5-Apr-18 @ 6:14 PMI have a 3 day / 21 hour contract. For the past 2 years since starting there I have worked every other weekend with varying days in the week. Employer requests if we are unable to work over time on a weekend off to inform them so they don’t Rota us in to work. I have a few weekends off authorised (not annual leave) I have recently taken on a promotion (change in the pattern- every other weekend was not mentioned at the time) They are now expecting me to work 2 weeks in and 1 off. (Which I’m not happy about) And any of my original weekends off I had authorised before I now need to use my annual leave allowance for them if I wish to still have them off. Can they expect me to use my annual leave even though it was authorised days off? I only made plans for these dates because they were days off so I didn’t have to use my holiday allowance. Dog lover - 5-Apr-18 @ 5:00 PMClixby- Your Question: Hi, I am contracted to 37.5 hours a week, but on my third day I was asked to work nights 12 hours shifts 4 on 4 off, which was no problem, this means I am now working 48 hours a week, does this automatically become my standard working hours after a certain period of time? I have been doing them for 4 months now! Thanks Our Response: It\\'s not clear how you\\'ve arrived at 48 hours per week if you\\'re working 4 on 4 off. Do your shifts have a break? Is this paid. If so, over a normal working week you average 3.5 xtwelve hour shifts, which is 42 hours per week. If you have an unpaid break of 1 hours in each shift it\\'s actually 38.5 hours per week. So you really need to find out what reference period is being used to calculate your weekly hours - if they don\\'t match the 37.5 hours in your contract, you can object. See our guide for more details Safe Workers - 4-Apr-18 @ 2:21 PMIam currently working 3 day a week my boss wants to cut me to two days Iam having to have time of in July for operation will be off approx 6 weeks is she aloud to do this and set someone else on to do my hours thankyou Liz - 3-Apr-18 @ 4:41 PMSha - Your Question: I am contract 42 hours and any hours over 42 I have to work to keep my store open I am ment to be given back in Lou. The only problem is there is never no staff to work in my store to cover me so continue to work 50+ hours a week only being paid 42. What am I meant to do in this situation can I force them to pay me if after a time frame it obvious I\\'m not getting the hours back. Our Response: You need to address this with your employer - if they are uncooperative, give ACAS a call. Safe Workers - 3-Apr-18 @ 3:24 PMBubbles - Your Question: I was hoping someone here would be able to help with some advice. The company I work for is bringing in company wide changes, one of which being that we will no longer get paid breaks and that break times will automatically be deducted in payroll. I work a 16hour contract and if I have this time taken off my hours I will fall below the threshold for tax credits and will literally not be able to afford to live in my house. I have asked if it’s possible to forego breaks (I work less than 6 hour shifts and am over 18 so my breaks aren’t a legal requirement but more of a company courtesy) and have been told that wouldn’t be allowed, I’ve asked if I can stay on 15 mins at the end of my shifts to make time up and have also been told that this isn’t a possibility either. The changes have stated that the everyone will be asked to sign these new contracts and if they refuse they’ll be told to leave, where do I stand with this and is it even legal? I can’t afford to lose my job and will be screwed if I go below the tax credits threshold Our Response: If you object to changes in your contract, there are things that you can do..

They decide to do not send any document with our rota. So from now on, we have to call the agency every day and write down what is said on the phone. During the first week of using this new system there were a lot of cancellations and staff went to work and had to come back home because the care home cancelled the agency, but the agency failed to call care workers. On the other hand, the agency said I did not go to work one day, but I was not agreed. So they charge me to cover their loss because according to them i was given the right rota at the phone. When I ask to check again the week, At the phone, of course, the manager said no. It was the first time in more than a year that this happened. How can I prove right or wrong, confirm or check a rota if I do not have any document to prove it? English is not my first language so mistakes can happen, even speaking the same language. So my question is, Is it legal to refuse to provide a written document with the rota when we are talking about 2 weeks rota in different care homes with different shifts? emalasos - 28-Mar-18 @ 9:59 PMHi, I have a 20 hour a week contract. Since I started in September 2015 I have been working full time, which is great. Just what I want. I have always worked full time since I started to present date, March 2018. Can my employer suddenly drop me to 20 hours per week? Please advise. I am worried that if so, I would need to get a new job and leave this current job I dearly love. Funkie76 - 27-Mar-18 @ 4:36 PMOne of my colleagues will be going off sick for approx 5-6weeks. I may have to cover her whilst she is off but im worried my employer will try and spread my normal working hours over the 5 days (i usually work 10 hours a day, 3 days a week) instead of me working my normal 3 days and me covering the hours she would normally work on the other 2 days. The problem I have with this is that I also have a second job which helps boost my income which i normally work on the other 2 days. I am happy to cover my colleague as long as I am also paid for the hours that she would normally work them two days (as I wouldnt be losing out on any money this way). Other employees within my company get to work over time hours to cover people so im pretty sure this could go down as a breach of equality. TP - 27-Mar-18 @ 9:24 AMMy shift pattern has changed , I’ve used all my holidays leave, an now because my day off has changed. I need to use a days holiday that I don’t have. Do I have to take the day off unpaid? Or do work have tohonour that day as my day off because it was booked before the change ? Mary - 26-Mar-18 @ 10:38 PMHi my company has just said that our shift pattern is changing and I have stated that I don\\'t wish for the change due to concerns over the travel period to and from roads especially during the 1 shift they have said is planned is there anything I can do so that I don\\'t end up being put on these shifts and stay as I am? Noofyourbusiness - 22-Mar-18 @ 3:59 PMHi, I work for a company who intend to not open Christmas Eve, however they want us to work on a Sunday instead to make up the hours. As Christmas Eve is a normal working day I am prepared to work it. Sunday working is not mentioned in my contract and normally that day is paid as double time. Can they do this? BJM - 22-Mar-18 @ 1:54 PMTo whom it may concern, I started a job in September, contracted at 64 hours per month. I was advised it would be varied shifts. Then all of a sudden when I was getting my rota and I realised there were a lot of weekends. I spoke to the manager about this several times saying I don’t mind doing the odd evening during the week but I cannot do every weekend because I’m a single parent, my daughter is nine. At first she advised me that I shouldn’t have to do every weekend and she took on another staff member to take the pressure off. The new staff member then started saying that she too didn’t want to do constant weekends and started booking weekends off and trying to ask the manager if she could not work certain weekends. Our manager doesn’t seem to have a problem with helping her out with weekends but in the meantime I was still given every weekend. I had a chat with my manager and said to her it is impossible for me to do every weekend and that I need to do more hours in the week, I said to her that I cannot keep doing all these weekends if it continues then I will have to look for another job. I then done a Sunday evening with another staff member who was new but she was only there on as and when basis, she advised me that she was coming to work and she was hired as a Saturday girl from End of March. She then went on to tell me that she had actually been offered my job and they were waiting for me to leave by the end of March so that she could start. I was so shocked and upset because I’ve never actually told my work that I was planning on leaving any time soon I just said that the Saturdays were too much and that something needed to change. She has since hired another casual member of staff even though I was told there wasn’t enough hours for me anymore. I then got an email off my manager titled moving on and it said in the email so we can get organised I was thinking that you should leave end of March if not Sooner. I emailed her back and said I do not plan on leaving my job or at least any time soon I just said that the Saturdays were too much. I then said to her that I wasn’t happy that I had heard that she had already offered my job to somebody else without me even saying I was going to leave. I had to go into work and have a meeting in which I advised them that I’m happy to do two weekends in four, I was then advised that there wouldn’t actually be enough hours for me if I didn’t do every Saturday and that there has to be a cut-off point in which I leave basically so this new girl can start, I asked them why they had hired somebody else when I hadn’t actually said I was going to leave, and they advise me that they had and that she was just there for evening and weekends. Since all of this happened I have been getting a lot of hassle at work, they have been picking on me almost for everything and most things are minor. My manager has been going upstairs and leaving me to deal with a busy cafe all day alone. Rose2887 - 21-Mar-18 @ 4:09 PMMuggins- Your Question: Another hospital worker here but not for nhs. Employed for 18 yrs originally 40 hrs. 5 yrs ago they reduced my hours to 25 I didn’t query it just accepted that I wasn’t needed as much. Now I’ve been told that my 25 hr week is to be split over 6 days. I don’t know where my contract is. Thnx Our Response: Ask for a copy of your contract. Until you know what you\\'re legally contracted to work (and therefore your employer\\'s responsibility to pay you), there isn\\'t much advice you can be given. Safe Workers - 19-Mar-18 @ 3:28 PMEY - Your Question: My partner has worked as a gardener for a private school for 7 years. His current contract says he is entitled to 2 breaks so takes 15 mins in the morning then 45 mins for lunch. Managent want to force him to take 2 x 1 hour break at lunchtime, can they do this? Any help greatly appreciated!Current hours Start 7.30am Break 9.30-9.45Lunch 12-12.45Finish 4.30pm Our Response: If his contract says he is entitled to two breaks, then that is what he should be able to take. If his employer wants to change the terms of the contract, they must get his consent first. See our guide to objecting to changes in your employment contract Safe Workers - 19-Mar-18 @ 12:40 PMLT - Your Question: My Main Contract of employment states my hours are 9am to 5.30pm with 45minutes lunch break. This refers to fulltime, however, in January 2017 I reduced my working hours to four days per week, 9am to 5.30pm with one Saturday (4.5hours) per month. I had a letter confirming that this was being implemented with a review after three months to see if it was working. This review only took place because I approached my boss and asked him if I could continue with my reduced hours, he verbally agreed that I could, no written confirmation was every received. I have just found out from a colleague that my boss is seeking legal advice to see if he can make me return to working fulltime. Due to health problems, I had a Stroke last September and have other ongoing health issues, I really do not feel that I could cope with fulltime. If he does ask me to return to fulltime work do I have to considering I have been only doing the part time hours for over twelve months? Our Response: The reduced hours were given on the condition of the review taking place. The issue is whether your boss\\'s agreement to continue was a definitive or whether he agreed in principal subject to further research/conversations with colleagues etc. In generalwhen an employer agrees to a request for flexible working they must change the terms and conditions in the employee’s contract.

       "        {'text': 'Titration From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search Not to be confused with tetration. This article is about volumetric titration. For other uses, see Titration (disambiguation). Acid–base titration is a quantitative analysis of concentration of an unknown acid or base solution. Titration, also known as titrimetry, [1] is a common laboratory method of quantitativechemical analysis that is used to determine the unknown concentration of an identified analyte. Since volume measurements play a key role in titration, it is also known as volumetric analysis. A reagent, called the titrant or titrator [2] is prepared as a standard solution. A known concentration and volume of titrant reacts with a solution of analyte or titrand [3] to determine concentration. The volume of titrant reacted is called titration volume.

Tiltre became titre, [4] which thus came to mean the \"fineness of alloyed gold\", [5] and then the \"concentration of a substance in a given sample\". [6] In 1828, the French chemist Gay-Lussac first used titre as a verb ( titrer ), meaning \"to determine the concentration of a substance in a given sample\". [7]Volumetric analysis originated in late 18th-century France. François-Antoine-Henri Descroizilles ( fr) developed the first burette (which was similar to a graduated cylinder) in 1791. [8] [9] [10] Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac developed an improved version of the burette that included a side arm, and coined the terms \" pipette \" and \" burette \" in an 1824 paper on the standardization of indigo solutions. [11] The first true burette was invented in 1845 by the French chemist Étienne Ossian Henry (1798–1873). [12] [13] A major breakthrough in the methodology and popularization of volumetric analysis was due to Karl Friedrich Mohr, who redesigned the burette into a simple and convenient form, and who wrote the first textbook on the topic, Lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen Titrirmethode ( Textbook of analytical chemistry titration methods ), published in 1855. [14] [15]Procedure [ edit]Analysis of soil samples by titration A typical titration begins with a beaker or Erlenmeyer flask containing a very precise volume of the analyte and a small amount of indicator (such as phenolphthalein) placed underneath a calibrated burette or chemistry pipetting syringe containing the titrant. Small volumes of the titrant are then added to the analyte and indicator until the indicator changes color in reaction to the titrant saturation threshold, reflecting arrival at the endpoint of the titration. Depending on the endpoint desired, single drops or less than a single drop of the titrant can make the difference between a permanent and temporary change in the indicator. When the endpoint of the reaction is reached, the volume of reactant consumed is measured and used to calculate the concentration of analyte bywhere C a is the concentration of the analyte, typically in molarity; C t is the concentration of the titrant, typically in molarity; V t is the volume of the titrant used, typically in liters; M is the mole ratio of the analyte and reactant from the balanced chemical equation; and V a is the volume of the analyte used, typically in liters. [16]Preparation techniques [ edit]Typical titrations require titrant and analyte to be in a liquid (solution) form. Though solids are usually dissolved into an aqueous solution, other solvents such as glacial acetic acid or ethanol are used for special purposes (as in petrochemistry ). [17] Concentrated analytes are often diluted to improve accuracy. Many non-acid–base titrations require a constant p H throughout the reaction. Therefore, a buffer solution may be added to the titration chamber to maintain the p H. [18]In instances where two reactants in a sample may react with the titrant and only one is the desired analyte, a separate masking solution may be added to the reaction chamber which masks the unwanted ion. [19]Some redox reactions may require heating the sample solution and titrating while the solution is still hot to increase the reaction rate. For instance, the oxidation of some oxalate solutions requires heating to 60 °C (140 °F) to maintain a reasonable rate of reaction. [20]Titration curves [ edit]Main article: Titration curve A typical titration curve of a diprotic acid titrated with a strong base. Shown here is oxalic acid titrated with sodium hydroxide. Both equivalence points are visible. A titration curve is a curve in the plane whose x -coordinates are the volume of titrant added since the beginning of the titration, and whose y -coordinate is the concentration of the analyte at the corresponding stage of the titration (in an acid–base titration, the y -coordinate is usually the p H of the solution). [21]In an acid – base titration, the titration curve reflects the strength of the corresponding acid and base. For a strong acid and a strong base, the curve will be relatively smooth and very steep near the equivalence point. Because of this, a small change in titrant volume near the equivalence point results in a large p H change and many indicators would be appropriate (for instance litmus, phenolphthalein or bromothymol blue ). If one reagent is a weak acid or base and the other is a strong acid or base, the titration curve is irregular and the p H shifts less with small additions of titrant near the equivalence point. For example, the titration curve for the titration between oxalic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is pictured. The equivalence point occurs between p H 8-10, indicating the solution is basic at the equivalence point and an indicator such as phenolphthalein would be appropriate. Titration curves corresponding to weak bases and strong acids are similarly behaved, with the solution being acidic at the equivalence point and indicators such as methyl orange and bromothymol blue being most appropriate. Titrations between a weak acid and a weak base have titration curves which are highly irregular. Because of this, no definite indicator may be appropriate and a p H meter is often used to monitor the reaction. [22]The type of function that can be used to describe the curve is called a sigmoid function. Types of titrations [ edit]There are many types of titrations with different procedures and goals. The most common types of qualitative titration are acid–base titrations and redox titrations. Acid–base titration [ edit]Main article: Acid–base titration Methyl orange Indicator Color on acidic side Range of color change Color on basic side Methyl violet Yellow 0.0–1.6 Violet Bromophenol blue Yellow 3.0–4.6 Blue Methyl orange Red 3.1–4.4 Yellow Methyl red Red 4.4–6.3 Yellow Litmus Red 5.0–8.0 Blue Bromothymol blue Yellow 6.0–7.6 Blue Phenolphthalein Colorless 8.3–10.0 Pink Alizarin yellow Yellow 10.1–12.0 Red Acid–base titrations depend on the neutralization between an acid and a base when mixed in solution. In addition to the sample, an appropriate p H indicator is added to the titration chamber, reflecting the p H range of the equivalence point. The acid–base indicator indicates the endpoint of the titration by changing color. The endpoint and the equivalence point are not exactly the same because the equivalence point is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction while the endpoint is just the color change from the indicator. Thus, a careful selection of the indicator will reduce the indicator error. For example, if the equivalence point is at a p H of 8.4, then the Phenolphthalein indicator would be used instead of Alizarin Yellow because phenolphthalein would reduce the indicator error. Common indicators, their colors, and the p H range in which they change color are given in the table above. [23] When more precise results are required, or when the reagents are a weak acid and a weak base, a p H meter or a conductance meter are used. For very strong bases, such as organolithium reagent, metal amides, and hydrides, water is generally not a suitable solvent and indicators whose p Ka are in the range of aqueous p H changes are of little use. Instead, the titrant and indicator used are much weaker acids, and anhydrous solvents such as THF are used. [24] [25]Phenolphthalein, a commonly used indicator in Acid and Base Titration The approximate p H during titration can be approximated by three kinds of calculations. Before beginning of titration, the concentration of is calculated in aqueous solution of weak acid before adding any base. When the number of moles of bases added equals the number of moles of initial acid or so called equivalence point, one of hydrolysis and the p H is calculated in the same way that the conjugate bases of the acid titrated was calculated. Between starting and end points, is obtained from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and titration mixture is considered as buffer. In Henderson-Hasselbalch equation the [acid] and [base] are said to be the molarities that would have been present even with dissociation or hydrolysis. In a buffer, can be exactly calculated but the dissociation of HA, the hydrolysis of and self-ionization of water must be taken into account. [26] Four independent equations must be used: [27]In the equations, and are the moles of acid ( HA) and salt ( XA where X is the cation), respectively, used in the buffer, and the volume of solution is V. The law of mass action is applied to the ionization of water and the dissociation of acid to derived the first and second equations. The mass balance is used in the third equation, where the sum of and must equal to the number of moles of dissolved acid and base, respectively. Charge balance is used in the fourth equation, where the left hand side represents the total charge of the cations and the right hand side represents the total charge of the anions: is the molarity of the cation (e.g. sodium, if sodium salt of the acid or sodium hydroxide is used in making the buffer). [28]Redox titration [ edit]Main article: Redox titration Redox titrations are based on a reduction-oxidation reaction between an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent. A potentiometer or a redox indicator is usually used to determine the endpoint of the titration, as when one of the constituents is the oxidizing agent potassium dichromate. The color change of the solution from orange to green is not definite, therefore an indicator such as sodium diphenylamine is used. [29] Analysis of wines for sulfur dioxide requires iodine as an oxidizing agent. In this case, starch is used as an indicator; a blue starch-iodine complex is formed in the presence of excess iodine, signalling the endpoint. [30]Some redox titrations do not require an indicator, due to the intense color of the constituents. For instance, in permanganometry a slight persisting pink color signals the endpoint of the titration because of the color of the excess oxidizing agent potassium permanganate. [31] In iodometry, at sufficiently large concentrations, the disappearance of the deep red-brown triiodide ion can itself be used as an endpoint, though at lower concentrations sensitivity is improved by adding starch indicator, which forms an intensely blue complex with triiodide. Color of iodometric titration mixture before (left) and after (right) the end point Gas phase titration [ edit]Gas phase titrations are titrations done in the gas phase, specifically as methods for determining reactive species by reaction with an excess of some other gas, acting as the titrant. In one common gas phase titration, gaseous ozone is titrated with nitrogen oxide according to the reaction O 3 + NO → O 2 + NO 2. [32] [33]After the reaction is complete, the remaining titrant and product are quantified (e.g., by FT-IR ); this is used to determine the amount of analyte in the original sample. Gas phase titration has several advantages over simple spectrophotometry. First, the measurement does not depend on path length, because the same path length is used for the measurement of both the excess titrant and the product. Second, the measurement does not depend on a linear change in absorbance as a function of analyte concentration as defined by the Beer-Lambert law. Third, it is useful for samples containing species which interfere at wavelengths typically used for the analyte. [34]Complexometric titration [ edit]Main article: Complexometric titration Complexometric titrations rely on the formation of a complex between the analyte and the titrant. In general, they require specialized complexometric indicators that form weak complexes with the analyte. The most common example is the use of starch indicator to increase the sensitivity of iodometric titration, the dark blue complex of starch with iodine and iodide being more visible than iodine alone. Other complexometric indicators are Eriochrome Black T for the titration of calcium and magnesium ions, and the chelating agent EDTA used to titrate metal ions in solution. [35]Zeta potential titration [ edit]Main article: Zeta potential titration Zeta potential titrations are titrations in which the completion is monitored by the zeta potential, rather than by an indicator, in order to characterize heterogeneous systems, such as colloids. [36] One of the uses is to determine the iso-electric point when surface charge becomes zero, achieved by changing the p H or adding surfactant. Another use is to determine the optimum dose for flocculation or stabilization. [37]Assay [ edit]Main articles: Assay and Virus quantification An assay is a form of biological titration used to determine the concentration of a virus or bacterium. Serial dilutions are performed on a sample in a fixed ratio (such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc.) until the last dilution does not give a positive test for the presence of the virus. The positive or negative value may be determined by visually inspecting the infected cells under a microscope or by an immunoenzymetric method such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This value is known as the titer. [38]Measuring the endpoint of a titration [ edit]Main article: Equivalence point Different methods to determine the endpoint include: [39]Indicator: A substance that changes color in response to a chemical change. An acid–base indicator (e.g., phenolphthalein) changes color depending on the p H. Redox indicators are also used. A drop of indicator solution is added to the titration at the beginning; the endpoint has been reached when the color changes. Potentiometer: An instrument that measures the electrode potential of the solution. These are used for redox titrations; the potential of the working electrode will suddenly change as the endpoint is reached. An elementary p H meter that can be used to monitor titration reactionsp H meter: A potentiometer with an electrode whose potential depends on the amount of H + ion present in the solution. (This is an example of an ion-selective electrode .) The p H of the solution is measured throughout the titration, more accurately than with an indicator; at the endpoint there will be a sudden change in the measured p H. Conductivity: A measurement of ions in a solution. Ion concentration can change significantly in a titration, which changes the conductivity. (For instance, during an acid–base titration, the H + and OH − ions react to form neutral H 2 O.) As total conductance depends on all ions present in the solution and not all ions contribute equally (due to mobility and ionic strength ), predicting the change in conductivity is more difficult than measuring it. Color change: In some reactions, the solution changes color without any added indicator. This is often seen in redox titrations when the different oxidation states of the product and reactant produce different colors. Precipitation: If a reaction produces a solid, a precipitate will form during the titration. A classic example is the reaction between Ag + and Cl − to form the insoluble salt Ag Cl. Cloudy precipitates usually make it difficult to determine the endpoint precisely. To compensate, precipitation titrations often have to be done as \"back\" titrations (see below). Isothermal titration calorimeter: An instrument that measures the heat produced or consumed by the reaction to determine the endpoint. Used in biochemical titrations, such as the determination of how substrates bind to enzymes. Thermometric titrimetry: Differentiated from calorimetric titrimetry because the heat of the reaction (as indicated by temperature rise or fall) is not used to determine the amount of analyte in the sample solution. Instead, the endpoint is determined by the rate of temperature change. Spectroscopy: Used to measure the absorption of light by the solution during titration if the spectrum of the reactant, titrant or product is known. The concentration of the material can be determined by Beer\\'s Law. Amperometry: Measures the current produced by the titration reaction as a result of the oxidation or reduction of the analyte. The endpoint is detected as a change in the current. This method is most useful when the excess titrant can be reduced, as in the titration of halides with Ag +. Endpoint and equivalence point [ edit]Though equivalence point and endpoint are used interchangeably, they are different terms. Equivalence point is the theoretical completion of the reaction: the volume of added titrant at which the number of moles of titrant is equal to the number of moles of analyte, or some multiple thereof (as in polyprotic acids). Endpoint is what is actually measured, a physical change in the solution as determined by an indicator or an instrument mentioned above. [40]There is a slight difference between the endpoint and the equivalence point of the titration. This error is referred to as an indicator error, and it is indeterminate. [41]Back titration [ edit]Back titration is a titration done in reverse; instead of titrating the original sample, a known excess of standard reagent is added to the solution, and the excess is titrated. A back titration is useful if the endpoint of the reverse titration is easier to identify than the endpoint of the normal titration, as with precipitation reactions. Back titrations are also useful if the reaction between the analyte and the titrant is very slow, or when the analyte is in a non- soluble solid. [42]Graphical methods [ edit]The titration process creates solutions with compositions ranging from pure acid to pure base. Identifying the p H associated with any stage in the titration process is relatively simple for monoprotic acids and bases. The presence of more than one acid or base group complicates these computations. Graphical methods, [43] such as the equiligraph, [44] have long been used to account for the interaction of coupled equilibria. These graphical solution methods are simple to implement, however they are infrequently used. Particular uses [ edit]A titration is demonstrated to secondary school students. Acid–base titrations [ edit]In biodiesel: waste vegetable oil (WVO) must be neutralized before a batch may be processed. A portion of WVO is titrated with a base to determine acidity, so the rest of the batch may be properly neutralized. This removes free fatty acids from the WVO that would normally react to make soap instead of biodiesel. [45]Kjeldahl method: a measure of nitrogen content in a sample. Organic nitrogen is digested into ammonia with sulfuric acid and potassium sulfate. Finally, ammonia is back titrated with boric acid and then sodium carbonate. [46]Acid value: the mass in milligrams of potassium hydroxide (KOH) required to titrate fully an acid in one gram of sample. An example is the determination of free fatty acid content. Saponification value: the mass in milligrams of KOH required to saponify a fatty acid in one gram of sample. Saponification is used to determine average chain length of fatty acids in fat. Ester value (or ester index): a calculated index. Ester value = Saponification value – Acid value. Amine value: the mass in milligrams of KOH equal to the amine content in one gram of sample. Hydroxyl value: the mass in milligrams of KOH corresponding to hydroxyl groups in one gram of sample. The analyte is acetylated using acetic anhydride then titrated with KOH. Redox titrations [ edit]Winkler test for dissolved oxygen: Used to determine oxygen concentration in water. Oxygen in water samples is reduced using manganese (II) sulfate, which reacts with potassium iodide to produce iodine. The iodine is released in proportion to the oxygen in the sample, thus the oxygen concentration is determined with a redox titration of iodine with thiosulfate using a starch indicator. [47]Vitamin C: Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C is a powerful reducing agent. Its concentration can easily be identified when titrated with the blue dye Dichlorophenolindophenol ( DCPIP) which turns colorless when reduced by the vitamin. [48]Benedict\\'s reagent: Excess glucose in urine may indicate diabetes in the patient. Benedict\\'s method is the conventional method to quantify glucose in urine using a prepared reagent. In this titration, glucose reduces cupric ions to cuprous ions which react with potassium thiocyanate to produce a white precipitate, indicating the endpoint. [49]Bromine number: A measure of unsaturation in an analyte, expressed in milligrams of bromine absorbed by 100 grams of sample. Iodine number: A measure of unsaturation in an analyte, expressed in grams of iodine absorbed by 100 grams of sample. Miscellaneous [ edit]Karl Fischer titration: A potentiometric method to analyze trace amounts of water in a substance. A sample is dissolved in methanol, and titrated with Karl Fischer reagent. The reagent contains iodine, which reacts proportionally with water. Thus, the water content can be determined by monitoring the potential of excess iodine. [50]See also [ edit]Nonaqueous titration Primary standards are compounds with consistent and reliable properties used to prepare standard solutions for titrations. References [ edit]^ Whitney, W.

       "        {'text': 'What\\'s New About the Twinkie and Other Hostess Brands Favorites What\\'s New About the Twinkie and Other Hostess Brands Favorites By Susanna Kim July 9, 2013Lundmark WATCH New Twinkies to Have Longer Shelf Life Email Hostess Brands LLC is preparing for the return of the Twinkie in a week, without unionized workers, company stores or the pile of debt the predecessor company accumulated. The Twinkie\\'s shelf life will be 45 days when the baked good returns to grocery stores on July 15. That\\'s almost three weeks longer than the 26 days the former Twinkie was supposed to stay fresh . Customers can look forward to Twinkies, Cup Cakes, Ho Hos, Donettes, Ding Dongs, Zingers, fruit pies and mini muffins in the coming days while Sno Balls and Suzy Qs will be back in the next few months. Hostess Brands, based in Kansas City, Mo. had stopped operations at the last of its 11 factories in November after failing to reach an agreement with its second biggest union, the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers International Union. The company filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 16. The new owners of Hostess have cut the number of plants to four and the products will be sold through convenience and grocery stores only. Some 600 Hostess thrift stores have been closed permanently. Other differences for the new product include how the goods will be distributed. Company spokeswoman Hannah Arnold said \"90 percent of the product will still be delivered fresh,\" but some will be delivered frozen. \"A select number of customers - representing only about 10 percent of Hostess\\' distribution - have explicitly requested to receive frozen product,\" Arnold said. \"This allows the retailer to date the product for freshness, provides flexibility in filling their shelves and has no impact on the quality or taste of the products. The decision is up to the customer - the only stores that will receive frozen product are those that request it. \"In Photos: Over-the-Top Fast Food Creations She said the Twinkie\\'s extended shelf life is not new news, however. \"The improvement was made under the old company, products were introduced to the market on Nov. 1, 2012 prior to the company\\'s liquidation and prior to the sale of assets to the new owners,\" said Arnold, who declined to comment about what methods were used to extend shelf life. Mira Calton, nutritionist and co-author of the book, Rich Food, Poor Food, said freezing a product prior to delivery would \"most likely require additional preservatives and dough strengtheners being added to the recipes. \"Arnold said the snacks will be just as customers remembered them. In Photos: Hostess Products Through the Years\"When consumers are finally able to bite into Hostess snack cakes again on Monday, they are going to have the same delicious experience that has given these products their enduring appeal,\" she said. \"Very minor tweaks have been made to improve product quality, such as using dark cocoa instead of milk chocolate in the Cup Cakes to make them darker and richer. \"The prices are also not changing. A 10-pack box of Twinkies retails for $3.99, much lower than the hundreds of dollars some e Bay sellers were asking for last year when the Hostess folded. Hostess was first established in 1930 and was based in Kansas City. After emerging from bankruptcy in 2009, the company moved its headquarters to Irving, Texas. By the time of its second bankruptcy, it had $1.3 billion in debt, none of which the new company has taken on. Read More About a Worker Eating From a Wendy\\'s Frosty Machine and 7 Other Gross Fast-Food Moments The new owner and chief executive, C. Dean Metropoulos, is planning for 50 million Twinkies to be in stores during the first two weeks of the comeback. Hostess is operating factories in Schiller Park, Ill.; Columbus, Ga.; Indianapolis and Emporia, Kan. The company expects to have about 1,800 employees within months, according to a company spokeswoman. \"The new ownership is absolutely committed to baking top quality snack cakes and, in fact, is making major investments to ensure that Hostess products are as good, if not even better than before,\" said a spokeswoman for the new company, Hannah Arnold.

       "        {'text': \"Home Remedies for Low Blood Pressure Home Remedies for Low Blood Pressure (123)Prev 1 of 3 Next Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, is a condition in which a person’s blood pressure becomes so low that it causes symptoms like dizziness, fainting, fatigue, nausea, difficulty breathing, blurred vision, palpitations, and cold, clammy skin. People with an ideal weight and who are physically fit and active generally have a blood pressure reading lower than what is considered normal at 120/80 mm Hg. Yet, this is not unhealthy, especially when the symptoms are not experienced. However, when readings consistently remain around 90/60 mm Hg or lower, it is considered hypotension. Besides, when the blood pressure is extremely low, it may cause inadequate flow of blood to organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. The condition can be caused by issues like dehydration, prolonged bed rest, nutritional deficiencies, a decrease in blood volume, heart problems, pregnancy, endocrine disorders, and neurological conditions. Certain medications such as alpha blockers, beta blockers, diuretics, antidepressants, and others can also lead to low blood pressure. When dealing with low blood pressure, it is usually suggested to increase your salt and fluid intake. Before increasing your salt consumption, do check with your doctor. Also, cut down on alcoholic beverages and high-carbohydrate foods such as bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes. The proper treatment for this condition depends on the exact cause, but you can try some simple home remedies to alleviate symptoms. Here are the top 10 home remedies for low blood pressure.1. Salt Water Salt water helps treat low blood pressure because the sodium in salt increases blood pressure. Do not overdo this remedy though, as excess salt can prove to be unhealthy. Simply mix one-half teaspoon of salt in a glass of water and drink it. You can also drink sports beverages.2. Coffee Having a cup of strong coffee, hot chocolate, cola, or any caffeinated beverage can also temporarily increase your blood pressure. If you frequently suffer from low blood pressure, drink a cup of coffee in the morning or have it along with meals, especially when dealing with orthostatic hypotension. But, do not make it a habit because the long-term effects of caffeine are not clear.3. Raisins Raisins are a traditional Ayurvedic remedy that is considered excellent for treating hypotension naturally. Soak 30 to 40 raisins in a cup of water overnight. Eat them in the morning, one at a time, on an empty stomach. You can also drink the water in which the raisins were soaked. Follow this remedy for a few weeks or even a month. You can take about four to five almonds, 10 to 15 black currants, and 15 to 20 peanuts along with a glass of milk.4. Holy Basil Holy basil is beneficial for low blood pressure because it is rich in vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, and pantothenic acid. Furthermore, it helps balance the mind and reduces stress. Extract the juice of 10 to 15 basil leaves. Add one teaspoon of honey to it. Drink this juice daily on an empty stomach. You can also chew four to five basil leaves daily in the morning.5. Licorice Root Licorice root is another popular home remedy for normalizing low blood pressure caused by low levels of cortisol. It blocks the enzyme that breaks down cortisol and supports healthy adrenalin function. It is also effective in curing chronic fatigue syndrome. You can prepare licorice tea by steeping one teaspoon of this herb (dried or powdered) in a cup of boiling water for about five minutes. You can take it daily for a few days. Alternatively, you can take about 400-500 mg of licorice root capsules for a few days.6. Beetroot Juice Raw beetroot juice is helpful in dealing with high as well as low blood pressure. For hypotension, drink a cup of beetroot juice twice daily for about one week. Other natural fruit juices are also considered helpful in this regard.

[ citation needed]Shop NBC/HQ [ edit]In 2000, NBC purchased a share of the company. [5] In November of that year, Value Vision was rebranded as Shop NBC, including a logo with the NBC peacock. [6]Reports surfaced in 2010 stating NBC would sell its stake in Value Vision, due in part to NBC Universal \\'s pending merger with Comcast. NBCUniversal formally announced that it would sell its stake back to Value Vision Media in May 2010, [7] but ultimately decided in June 2010 to retain its stake in the company. [8]Value Vision acquired NBCUniversal\\'s financial stake in the company in 2013, and announced the network would be renamed Shop HQ. [4] Mark Cuban \\'s American Dream aired on the network in 2014, and was part of a plan under the Clinton Group management to feature more celebrity hosts. [9]Evine [ edit]On February 13, 2015, the Shop HQ network was rebranded as EVINE Live, following Value Vision Media\\'s acquisition of e-commerce company Dollars Per Minute, the owner of the EVINE trademark, in order to distance itself from the reputation it held under Value Vision/Shop NBC/Shop HQ. [10] The network hired former QVC host Kathy Levine, and has featured merchandise branded under different reality TV stars, including Lisa Vanderpump and Countess Luann De Lesseps. The company has also premiered concepts from other well-known celebrities, including Paula Deen, Vanessa Williams, Nancy O’Dell, Holly Robinson Peete, Karen Fairchild, Dr. Terry Dubrow and Heather Dubrow, Todd English, Donny Osmond and Bob Vila. It also sells products on its e-commerce website, Evine.com. EVINE Live launched a high definition feed of the channel in 1080i (including the acquisition of HD tier channel slots under new carriage agreements) the same year, but until September 2017, remained in standard definition, merely rebroadcasting the SD feed. The network converted to an upscaled standard definition widescreen presentation in the fall of 2016, and quietly upgraded to HD a year after. In July 2016, EVINE dropped \\'Live\\' from their on-air name. Former logos [ edit]Logo for when the network was known as Shop NBC.

We offer tips on what to wear and things to do throughout the month in the Big Apple. Temperatures tend to remain relatively low towards the beginning of the month, but can rise to the mid 60’s F (17-18C) by the end of the month. March weather can be fairly unpredictable as it falls right in between winter, but hopefully, this post will help you prepare for your trip to the NYC!Average Temperatures How Much Sun and Rain What to Wear Things to Do in March Things to Do Any Month Free Tours by Foot Be sure to read our posts on: Find March Deals and Discounts on NYC Tours and Attractions Learn about boat tours and cruises in NYC. Average Temperatures So, how is the weather in New York in March? Well, spring is in the air in New York City as March is a month that transitions from wintertime to spring. Early this month in New York City, afternoon high temperatures tend to be in the mid-40;s f (6-7C) while early morning lows tend to me in the low 30’s f (0 to -1C). On a few of the colder mornings, temperatures can still dip down into to upper teens (-7 to -8C). As the month progresses, spring starts to grab a hold in the Big Apple as the afternoon temperatures rise into the low to mid 50’s f (11-13C) and morning lows creep up into the upper 30’s f to near 40f (3-5C). A few of the warmer afternoons can even see temperatures up into the mid 60’s (17-18C). The highest temperature recorded this month at Central Park was 86f (30C) while the coldest ever was 3f (-16C). Back to top How Much Rain and Sun About 19 days this month will see sunny or at least partly sunny skies so get out and enjoy the improving weather. Some precipitation can be expected on about 10-11 days; however, only 2-3 days see significant amounts of 0.5 inches (13mm) or more. Snow can still fall in the city during March but is limited to about 2 days on average with 1 day receiving at least 1 inch (2.5CM). Snowfalls of 3 inches (7.6CM) or more occur about once every other year. The risk for snow is highest near the beginning of the month and drops significantly by month’s end. Back to top What to Wear in NYC in March March is the month of seasonal transition. Appropriate clothing can make or break a trip, so packing a little extra this month might be sensible for your stay in New York City. As the month progresses, spring appears. It’s not a perfect formula, so it’s a good idea to have layers and warm jacket. You’ll also want to bring a medium to light jacket for those days when the temperature rises into the 50’s and 60’s. The temperature will vary from scarves and gloves to skirts and short sleeves. Of course, your tolerance depends on what climate you’re coming from. It’s best to be prepared for both seasons so your comfort level is optimized, making your trip to the Big Apple the greatest experience of your lifetime!Things to Do in NYC in March On March 17th, the world’s oldest and largest parade, New York City Saint Patrick’s Day Parade celebrates Irish culture and the Catholic faith on 5th Avenue.

Substations are used for stepping up voltage for transmission, stepping it down for distribution, and for switching purposes. In this article we discuss the various functions of a substation and its working principles. We also discuss the safety devices used. Substation How does a substation work? Why is it known as a “substation? \"Normally stations are where we catch trains and where people get on and off. By the same analogy we can explain what a substation does. Electricity has to be transmitted over large distances as the place where the power is being generated and the place where it is consumed can be far apart. The electricity is transmitted at very high voltages and low currents to reduce the heat, eddy currents, and other transmission losses. The substations are where the voltages are increased to high values by using step up transformers, and after the transmission, they are again stepped down for distribution. In addition changing the voltages the substations have a variety of protective devices like circuit breakers and fuses to protect the distribution networks. These are designed in such a way that various distribution circuits can be isolated for repairs and load shedding. Substations are normally outdoors and are enclosed by a wire fence. However in residential or high density areas, the substation may be indoors and housed inside a building to restrict the humming noise of the huge transformers. View of a Substation Function of Substations The substations apart from the distribution of the electricity have many other functions as follows: Step up and step down of the voltage for transmission and distribution: As for the same power transmitted at a higher voltage the current is lower it results in lower transmission losses, hence is the need of stepping up and stepping down the voltage. Switching and isolating the circuits for maintenance: Switching is also an important function of substations. Closing down a feeder circuit when the load demands are high needs to be done for the safety of the generating plants. Switching high voltages is a dangerous work, and special circuit breakers like air circuit breakers and oil circuit breakers for quenching the arcs have to be used. Load shedding: When the power demand is more than the supply, the substations do load shedding on distribution circuits to maintain balance. Correction of power factors circuits: The power factor has to be kept at the correct value when reactive loads are there to protect the generating plant and increase efficiency. Safety devices like circuit breakers and fuses: These safety devices are provided for protecting the machineries on the distribution circuit as well as in the substation against high short circuit currents. It contains bus bars for splitting the power for distribution: Thick bars of copper to which various distributing circuits are connected by nuts and bolts are known as bus bars. Power Distribution Operation of a Substation Electricity is generated in a thermal power plant, hydroelectric power plant, and nuclear power plant, etc. This electricity is then supplied to a transmission substation near the generating plant. In the transmission substation the voltage is increased substantially using step up transformers. The voltage is increased to reduce the transmission losses over long distances. This electricity then is supplied to a power substation where it is stepped down using step down transformers and then supplied to a distribution grid. In the distribution grid there are additional transformers and voltage is further reduced for distributing further down the grid. From here the electricity is supplied to step down transformers near residential quarters that step down the voltage to 110/220 Volts as per each country\\'s requirement.

(verify)Prostacyclin (also called prostaglandin I2 or PGI 2) is a prostaglandin member of the eicosanoid family of lipid molecules. It inhibits platelet activation and is also an effective vasodilator. When used as a drug, it is also known as epoprostenol. [1] The terms are sometimes used interchangeably. [2]Contents [ hide ]1 Function2 Medical uses3 Degradation4 Mechanism5 Members [6]6 Pharmacology7 Synthesis7.1 Biosynthesis7.2 Artificial synthesis8 History9 See also10 References Function [ edit]Prostacyclin (PGI 2) chiefly prevents formation of the platelet plug involved in primary hemostasis (a part of blood clot formation). It does this by inhibiting platelet activation. [3] It is also an effective vasodilator. Prostacyclin\\'s interactions in contrast to thromboxane (TXA 2 ), another eicosanoid, strongly suggest a mechanism of cardiovascular homeostasis between the two hormones in relation to vascular damage. Medical uses [ edit]It is used to treat pulmonary artery hypertension. [4]Degradation [ edit]Prostacyclin, which has a half-life of 42 seconds, [5] is broken down into 6-keto-PGF 1, which is a much weaker vasodilator.

The platelet Gs protein-coupled receptor ( prostacyclin receptor) is activated when it binds to PGI 2. This activation, in turn, signals adenylyl cyclase to produce c AMP. c AMP goes on to inhibit any undue platelet activation (in order to promote circulation) and also counteracts any increase in cytosolic calcium levels that would result from thromboxane A2 (TXA 2) binding (leading to platelet activation and subsequent coagulation ). PGI 2 also binds to endothelial prostacyclin receptors and in the same manner raise c AMP levels in the cytosol. This c AMP then goes on to activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then continues the cascade by promoting the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain kinase, which inhibits it and leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. It can be noted that PGI 2 and TXA 2 work as physiological antagonists.

[7] Its production is inhibited indirectly by NSAIDs, which inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzymes COX1 and COX2. These convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH 2 ), the immediate precursor of prostacyclin. Since thromboxane (an eicosanoid stimulator of platelet aggregation) is also downstream of COX enzymes, one might think that the effect of NSAIDs would act to balance. However, prostacyclin concentrations recover much faster than thromboxane levels, so aspirin administration initially has little to no effect but eventually prevents platelet aggregation (the effect of prostaglandins predominates as they are regenerated). This is explained by understanding the cells that produce each molecule, TXA 2 and PGI 2. Since PGI 2 is primarily produced in a nucleated endothelial cell, the COX inhibition by NSAID can be overcome with time by increased COX gene activation and subsequent production of more COX enzymes to catalyze the formation of PGI 2. In contrast, TXA 2 is released primarily by anucleated platelets, which are unable to respond to NSAID COX inhibition with additional transcription of the COX gene because they lack DNA material necessary to perform such a task. This allows NSAIDs to result in PGI 2 dominance that promotes circulation and retards thrombosis. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, inhaled epoprostenol reduces pulmonary pressure, and improves right ventricular stroke work in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A dose of 60 µg is hemodynamically safe, and its effect is completely reversed after 25 minutes. No evidence of platelet dysfunction or an increase in surgical bleeding after administration of inhaled epoprostenol has been found. [8] The drug has been known to cause flushing, headaches and hypotension. [9]Synthesis [ edit]Biosynthesis [ edit]Eicosanoid synthesis. (Prostacyclin near bottom center. )Prostacyclin is produced in endothelial cells, which line the walls of arteries and veins, [10] from prostaglandin H 2 (PGH 2) by the action of the enzyme prostacyclin synthase. Although prostacyclin is considered an independent mediator, it is called PGI 2 (prostaglandin I 2) in eicosanoid nomenclature, and is a member of the prostanoids (together with the prostaglandins and thromboxane ). The series-3 prostaglandin PGH 3 also follows the prostacyclin synthase pathway, yielding another prostacyclin, PGI 3. [11] The unqualified term \\'prostacyclin\\' usually refers to PGI 2. PGI 2 is derived from the ω-6 arachidonic acid. PGI 3 is derived from the ω-3 EPA. Artificial synthesis [ edit]Prostacyclin can be synthesized from the methyl ester of prostaglandin F 2α. [12] After its synthesis, the drug is reconstituted in saline and glycerin. [13]History [ edit]During the 1960s, a U. K. research team, headed by Professor John Vane, began to explore the role of prostaglandins in anaphylaxis and respiratory diseases. Working with a team from the Royal College of Surgeons, Sir John discovered that aspirin and other oral anti-inflammatory drugs work by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. This critical finding opened the door to a broader understanding of the role of prostaglandins in the body. Sir John and a team from the Wellcome Foundation, had identified a lipid mediator they called “PG-X,” which inhibits platelet aggregation. PG-X, which later would become known as prostacyclin, is 30 times more potent than any other then-known anti-aggregatory agent. By 1976, John Vane and fellow researchers Salvador Moncada, Ryszard Gryglewski and Stuart Bunting published the first paper on prostacyclin, in the scientific journal Nature. [14] The collaboration produced a synthesized molecule, which was given the name epoprostenol. But, as with native prostacyclin, the structure of the epoprostenol molecule proved to be unstable in solution, prone to rapid degradation. [ citation needed] This presented a challenge for both in vitro experiments and clinical applications. To overcome this challenge, the research team that discovered prostacyclin was determined to continue the research in an attempt to build upon the success they had seen with the prototype molecule. The research team synthesized nearly 1,000 analogues.

       "        {'text': 'How to SAFELY Use the 11 Best Natural Antibiotics How to SAFELY Use the 11 Best Natural Antibioticsby Sarah Updated: February 01, 2018 Affiliate links Natural Remedies There is no doubt that antibiotics are truly a wonder of modern medicine. Beginning with the discovery of penicillin in 1928, the rapid resolution of bacterial infections from antibiotics caused many in the medical profession to become completely enamored with the drug based approach to illness erroneously thinking that the danger to human life from infections was a thing of the past. Not so fast. By 1940, antibiotics had come into widespread use causing both doctors and people to gradually forget about natural antibiotics for resolving infections and the age old remedies like cod liver oil. This change in the medical paradigm has led in recent decades to abuse of drug based antibiotics and the worrisome rise of antibiotic resistant superbugs such as the “TDR” (totally drug resistant) strain of tuberculosis and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections particularly in babies and children. The over-reliance on drug based resolution to infections has also triggered an epidemic of children and adults with compromised gut function and autoimmune diseases of all kinds due to an imbalanced intestinal environment and the consequential scourge of leaky gut syndrome. Beyond the problem of antibiotic resistance, however, are the long term effects of even a single round of antibiotics. The expectation in the health community that you can just fix the damage with probiotics and/or fermented foods and that gut flora magically returns to normal seems to be far from accurate. Evidence is now emerging from multiple sources that gut flora may actually be permanently altered by drugs or, at the very least, the damage persists for several years. The Journal Microbiology, for instance , reports that the generally acknowledged precept that use of antibiotics only causes disruption of the gut flora for a few weeks is highly flawed. Gut flora does not quickly return to normal after a round of antibiotics. Even a short course of antibiotics can lead to resistant bacterial populations taking up residence in the gut that persist for up to 4 years – maybe even longer (source)The bottom line is that drug based antibiotics really should only be used for life threatening situations – as a last resort if you will. For bothersome everyday infections that are not life threatening, however, nature provides some very powerful and effective alternatives. Here is the list of the best of these natural antibiotics which have succeeded in keeping my own family of five off all drug based antibiotics for colds, flu, skin and sinus infections for over 15 years (and counting!). This list of the best natural antibiotics on the planet is in no particular order although I make note of which one is my personal favorite. Note that the natural antibiotics listed below are frequently anti-viral and anti-fungal too unlike pharmaceuticals. They also should not be confused with remedies that help with prevention and/or easing of symptoms. The benefits of elderberry syrup for this purpose come to mind here. How to Use the Best Natural Antibiotics on the Planet Oregano Oil There are over 40 different oregano species, but the most beneficial one to maximize the therapeutic antibiotic effect you need is the oil produced from wild oregano, called Origanum vulgare. Thymus capitatus, a variety that grows in Spain, is also very powerful. Quality brands of oregano oil are made from these species. The oil is golden to dark yellow, with a strong spicy odor. According to Dr. Mercola, the best uses for oregano oil as a natural antibiotic are the following: Foot or nail fungus. Put a few teaspoons of oregano oil in a small tub water and soak your feet. The oil can also be diluted (one drop of oil with a teaspoon of olive oil) and then apply directly to nails or skin. Parasites and infections: Dilute the oil as described above and place it under your tongue. Hold it there for a few minutes, and then rinse it out. Repeat at least four times a day. Sinus infections: Put a few drops of oregano oil in a pot of steaming water or neti pot. Then, slowly inhale the steam. Cayenne Pepper Cayenne pepper also called capsicum is a strong spice used for thousands of years for its healing power and antibiotic effects. It’s not just an anecdotal, folklore remedy, however. Science is validating its use as a natural antibiotic as well. Cayenne pepper is particularly effective at resolving vulvovaginitis, a common infection in women. One Czech study found capsicum essential oil exerts a considerable anti-fungal and antibiotic effect on this condition. It is important to properly use a carrier oil such as olive oil and thoroughly dilute cayenne pepper essential oil, however, as capsicum is quite burning upon initial contact with the skin. Cayenne pepper is also very effective to use as a home remedy for strep throat. Colloidal Silver The remarkable antibiotic nature of silver has been known for centuries. In the early 1900′s, the founder of Searle Pharmaceuticals, Alfred Searle, wrote in his book The Complete Use of Colloids in Health and Disease: Applying colloidal silver to human subjects has been done in a large number of cases with astonishingly successful results…it has the advantage of being rapidly fatal to microbes without toxic action on its host. It is quite stable. It protects rabbits from ten times the lethal dose of tetanus or diphtheria toxin. In the 1970′s, Dr. Robert O. Becker at Syracuse Medical University began to intensively research colloidal silver. He discovered that silver not only kills bacteria, but it actually killed bacteria that were resistant to all known antibiotics with no undesirable side effects. While colloidal silver is highly antibiotic in nature, I suggest only using it for external uses such as gargling, ear infections like swimmers’ ear and skin. The reason is that ingestion of colloidal silver does damage the delicate gut microbiome by killing beneficial bacteria though not as extensively as drug based antibiotics. If you need the assistance of natural antibiotics to consume internally, choose another one on this list, not colloidal silver. Grapefruit Seed Extract (GSE)Grapefruit seed extract (GSE) has been reported to be a highly effective, natural antibiotic in combating a variety of common infectious agents. In one study, drops of concentrated grapefruit-seed extract were tested for antibacterial properties against a number of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The researchers concluded that GSE was comparable to “proven topical antibacterials. Although the GSE appeared to have a somewhat greater inhibitory effect on gram-positive organisms than on gram-negative organisms, its comparative effectiveness against a wide range of bacterial biotypes is significant.”Used full strength to combat warts, properly diluted GSE has a variety of uses to combat pathogens in your home environment. The only caveat is that commercial preparations of GSE have a chemical in them called diphenol hydroxybenzene that is of questionable safety and other chemicals like triclosan and cancer causing parabens that are definitely to be avoided. Therefore, if you intend to use GSE especially internally, it is best to make it yourself by grinding the grapefruit seeds and the juiceless pulp and then mixing with glycerin. Garlic Of all the natural antibiotics, garlic is my personal favorite and my family’s go-to for internal use. The reason is that it kills the pathogens, not just bacteria but also fungus and viruses too without harming beneficial gut flora. Garlic packs a punch with phytochemicals and healing sulfur components. These sulfur compounds even chelate toxic heavy metals (like lead & cadmium), binding with them for excretion out of the body. It has antibacterial, anti-fungal, and even anti-viral qualities. It promotes the growth of healthy intestinal microflora by acting as a prebiotic (food for probiotics). Garlic helps keep fats from oxidizing. Garlic acts as a strong antioxidant and guards against DNA damage. It protects against radiation & sunlight damage. Garlic fights worms and parasites. It benefits digestion, which is good for the whole body. It contains many nutrients such as vitamins (C, B 1, B 2, B 3 ), minerals (calcium, folate, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, zinc, and phytochemicals (Allicin, beta-carotene, beta-sitosterol, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, diallyl-disulfide, ferulic acid, geraniol, kaempferol, linalool, oleanolic acid, p-coumaric acid, phloroglucinol, phytic acid, quercetin, rutin, s-allyl-cysteine, saponin, sinapic acid, & stigmasterol). The phytochemical allicin in garlic is so powerful that it is one of the best natural antibiotics effective against MRSA. This article on MRSA natural remedies describes how to use it appropriately for this purpose. Dr. Natasha Campbell-Mc Bride MD suggests consuming a whole head of garlic a day when using for natural antibiotic purposes. She also outlines how to make garlic infused olive oil as a remedy for ear and other external infections.1 crushed clove of garlic1 – 2 tablespoons cold pressed extra virgin olive oil Place the crushed garlic in the oil and let sit for 30 minutes, then strain. The oil can be warmed slightly by placing it in a cup and setting the cup in warm water (don’t overheat or this will destroy beneficial properties). Use a few drops of this oil hourly in the ears to treat an ear infection. Garlic oil is a safe remedy for children and can also be used daily (just a couple of drops) to soften ear wax buildup. If you are concerned about the heat and odor potential on breath and sweat from consuming raw garlic cloves, you can use this pickled garlic recipe to substitute fermented garlic cloves instead. Do not use commercial pickled garlic as it has no therapeutic value. Ginger Have you ever wondered why pickled, raw ginger is nearly always served with sushi? This is likely because of historical folklore concerning ginger’s natural antibiotic effects which help prevent food poisoning. Studies have shown that fresh ginger really does have an antibiotic effect against food borne pathogens such as salmonella, listeria and campylobacter. Fresh ginger also increases stomach acid production and helps calm indigestion when a meal just doesn’t agree with you. So, if you are going to eat something that has the potential for food borne illness such as sushi or raw oysters, always best to eat some fresh ginger (raw and pickled is most potent) too in order to make use of its natural antibiotic properties. The Master Tonic, a powerful anti-viral and natural antibiotic, includes plenty of fresh ginger as well as fresh cayenne pepper and garlic. This tonic is a highly effective concoction to make and take with you when traveling overseas in order to have a handy formula available that packs the punch of several natural antibiotics synergistically combined and fermented for maximum potency. Properly made ginger tea is helpful for digestive ailments such as the inability to absorb food properly and an overabundance of pathogens in the gut. Malabsorption of food can cause nutritional deficiencies that lead to disease over time. “ Everything good is found in ginger” declares an ancient Indian proverb. Olive Leaf Extract Most people are aware of the health benefits of pure, 100% extra virgin olive oil. However, many in the health community are still in the dark about the antibiotic effects of olive leaf extract coming from the very same trees!According to Dr. Ronald Hoffman MD, founder and Medical Director of the Hoffman Center in New York City, olive leaf extract as a healing modality was first realized in the 1800’s for malaria. Olive leaf extract may be best known for it’s ability to reduce fever even due to severe illness. Early in the last century, oleuropein was isolated from olive leaf extract as this phytochemical was thought to give the olive tree its resistance to disease. Researchers from the Netherlands then learned that elenolic acid, a component of oleuropein, acted as a broad spectrum natural antibiotic, which safely and strongly inhibits the growth of not only bacteria, but also viruses and fungi. Dr. Hoffman MD’s suggestion for use of olive leaf extract for long standing infections or candida is two 500 mg capsules (20% oleuropein) three to four times per day, preferably with meals. Turmeric Turmeric is a spice widely used in traditional Indian cooking that has been used holistically for centuries. Dr. Kelly Brogan MD uses turmeric holistically in her psychiatry practice. She writes,This wonder-spice is a mainstay of my anti-inflammatory work with patients in my practice where I use liposomal preparations of curcumin, the natural phenols responsible for turmeric’s yellow color, when I suspect their symptoms stem from a challenged immune system. In research, the curcumin in turmeric was shown to be effective against Helicobacter pylori common in gastroduodenal ulcers regardless of the genetic makeup of the strain. The administration of curcumin also resolved any gastric damage caused by the infection. Turmeric is also highly effective in providing allergy relief from the symptoms of allergic rhinitis or hay fever. If you wish to use turmeric as a natural antibiotic, Dr. Weil suggests to look for extracts in dosages of 400 to 600 mg, and take three times daily or as directed. Echinacea Echinacea is an herb widely used to fight infections and has been the subject of wide scientific research. Even Web MD is positive about it concluding that: Echinacea is widely used to fight infections, especially the common cold and other upper respiratory infections. Echinacea is also used against many other infections including the flu, urinary tract infections, vaginal yeast infections, genital herpes, bloodstream infections (septicemia), gum disease, tonsillitis, streptococcus infections, syphilis, typhoid, malaria, and diphtheria. German scientists have studied echinacea using double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, the gold standard for scientific research on drugs. One of these showed that echinacea users experienced less frequent and less severe virus infections by one-third to one-half with no toxic effects compared to the group that took a placebo. According to Dr. Sears MD, echinacea studies on adults suggest 300 mg three time a day for a total of 900 mg a day as a recommended regimen. For children, half the adult dose for ages 6-13, and one-quarter the adult dose for those under age six. Manuka Honey What would this list of natural antibiotics be without raw honey which has been used as an infection fighter since ancient times? Of all the honey on the planet, Manuka honey from New Zealand is the best when it comes to resolving infections. Just be sure it has never been heated (source)!I first used Manuka honey 16 years ago shortly after my first child was born to resolve a breastfeeding related infection. It worked so well I was able to avoid using antibiotics. I have also used it to very quickly heal strep throat without antibiotics for my tween daughter. According to Dr. Mercola, clinical trials have found that Manuka honey is effective against more than 250 strains of bacteria, including: MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus)VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci)Helicobacter Pylori (which can cause stomach ulcers)In 2007, the FDA even approved Manuka honey based wound dressings. The great thing about Manuka honey is that it is food. I’ve personally found it most effective for skin based infections (just slather on as needed), but the research indicates an internal infection fighting benefit as well even reducing the cavity causing bacteria responsible for dental plaque. Pau d’Arco Overuse of drug based antibiotics frequently leads to an overgrowth in the gut of a large family of yeasts or fungus known as Candida. Pau d’arco is an herb that is highly anti-Candida and significantly reduces the resultant sugar cravings that come with it. Repressing Candida and ingesting plenty of probiotics in the form of fermented foods and/or supplements will over time allow beneficial gut microbes to regain control of the gut environment. While Pau d’arco has been used as a medicine for centuries as one of the best natural antibiotics to counteract fungal overgrowth, science is also validating these anecdotal observations. The Brazilian Journal of Biology found in 2010 found that Tabebuia avellanedae, one tree species that is the source of the Pau d’arco herb, does indeed exert an inhibitory effect on yeasts. The form Pau d’arco is most often used is as an herbal tea, which I must admit, is an acquired taste! Even after drinking it as needed for the past 2 decades, I still don’t like it much! The good news is that the taste isn’t so terrible that you can’t drink a cup or two for a few days to a week or more. This will help you get back into the routine of healthy eating with sweets kept in moderation if Candida has gotten out of control during off the wagon eating while on vacation or due to a round of antibiotics. Which of the natural antibiotics on this list are your favorites? What do you use them for and when? Please note that if you absolutely have to use pharmaceuticals due to a very serious infection, repairing the gut after antibiotics is a very important process that should be undertaken immediately.

       "        {'text': 'Chipmunk Facts CHIPMUNKSChipmunk Facts Chipmunks are small, ground-dwelling members of the squirrel (Sciuridae) family known for their burrowing habits and love of nuts. Despite their size, chipmunks can cause significant damage to homes, yards, and farms. Below, learn important information about chipmunks, including general facts and how to identify chipmunk damage. General Facts » Geography »Habitat » Diet »Behavior » Identify Damage »Other Photos: SHARE: SHOP CHIPMUNK SOLUTIONS »Facts General Chipmunk Facts Chipmunk Classification - Genera: Tamias (eastern chipmunk - sp. Tamias striatus)Neotamias (mostly western chipmunks - 23 existing species)Eutamias (Siberian chipmunk - sp. Eutamias sibiricus)Average Size: 2-6\" long with a 3\" tail; less than 1 lb. in weight Average Lifespan in the Wild: 2-3 years Identifying Features: Shades of brown/yellow/grey fur with white and black stripes down the back Chipmunk Geography All species of chipmunks are native to North America, except one - the Siberian chipmunk. As indicated by its name, the eastern chipmunk inhabits most of the eastern half of the United States and Canada. Western chipmunks inhabit the western states as well as most of Canada. The Siberian chipmunk is the only species that is found outside of North America - its range extends throughout northern Asia, from central Russia to Japan. Chipmunk Habitat Chipmunks feel most at home in areas with plenty of ground cover, including logs, trees, stumps, shrubs and rocks. While the ideal habitat for chipmunks is a deciduous forest, woodland or brushland, they’re also comfortable in other areas that provide sufficient cover such as urban parks, fence lines, hedges and houses. Chipmunks dig extensive burrow systems directly underneath or next to natural or manmade cover. They dig two types of burrows: shallow burrows in which they seek refuge while foraging during the day, and deeper, more complex burrows where they nest, store food and spend most of the winter months. Chipmunks rarely venture further than 1/3 mile from their burrows at any time. Chipmunk Diet Chipmunks are omnivores, dining on various types of foods that are found mostly on the ground. Their diets are more diverse during the warmer months, during which time they hoard nuts and seeds in their burrows to eat in the winter. Some favorite foods include: Chipmunk Behavior Activity: Chipmunks are active in the daytime during spring, summer and fall. Chipmunks remain in their deep burrow systems during the winter, where they enter patterns of torpor (deep sleep and lower body temperature) interrupted by periods of feeding. Reproduction: Breeding occurs twice per year - once in the spring and once in the summer - when chipmunks give birth to 4-5 babies at a time. Burrowing: Chipmunks dig their own pairs of burrows, excavating as deep as 3 feet underground. Burrows are typically dug directly underneath or next to cover, because a chipmunk always requires protection from predators. Oftentimes chipmunk burrows cause damage when dug next to a home foundation Hoarding: To prepare for the winter hibernation period, chipmunks begin to stockpile nuts and seeds in their burrows during late summer and early fall. Communication: Chipmunks are protective of their burrows and use a range of loud chirps as well as body language to express occupied territory, dominance, or warn their young of danger. Females also have a mating call for which they use their high-pitched, bird-like vocalizations. Identify Chipmunk Damage Though chipmunks are small, they can be quite destructive - especially when burrowing near a home\\'s foundation. Here are some signs of chipmunk damage:structural or foundational damage from chipmunk burrowsholes in lawn or garden from digging for plant rootsseed piles underneath bird feedersuprooted bulbschipmunk tracks: tiny prints with four toes in the front and five in the back (front and hind feet are generally reversed)Fun Facts One tiny chipmunk can gather up to 165 acorns in one day. Chipmunks have pouches inside of their cheeks in which they store food when foraging. The main entrance of a chipmunk burrow can extend up to 20 feet in length. A group of chipmunks is called a scurry. How to Get Rid Of How to Trap How to Repel Baits ', 'score': '-5.72041'},\n",

Try adding oil to a hot pan (but be careful it doesn\\'t splatter). You could also try using a non-stick pan. Mrs_du_Toit from USA / flag if inappropriate I followed the recipe and used arepa flour. My arepas kept getting stuck to the pan and they broke up as I fried them. They tasted awesome but didn\\'t hold the shape. What did I do wrong?melazareal from NYC, NY / flag if inappropriate This was my first attempt to make arepas, and it was a success. As per another reviewer\\'s suggestion, I used queso blanco--yum! The arepas were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I topped them with salsa. The next day I reheated the leftovers and buttered them for a delicious snack. Will definitely make them again and again. Yvonne_CM from New York, NY / flag if inappropriate I just noticed I miss two items from my comment above... For the sweet \"mandocas\" I meant 1/2 inch to an inch thick stick and about 5 inches long... And before you put arepas in the oven you must grill on a flat grill, like pancake grill brush with a little oil for about 4-5 minutes each side then put in the oven. Lisseth / flag if inappropriate One thing about arepas that was never mentioned... In order to have the best arepas in the world you must knead the dough and as you knead it wet your hands and add a little water to make it a pliable dough, then form arepas... You don\\'t want it to be sticky... They are great fried, but my favorite is baked at 400\\' in the bottom rack and watch them balloon... Also another fun and delicious way to use this dough is to add molasses, brown sugar, ripe plantain grated and feta cheese (ideally \"queso blanco\" grated) then form a half inch to an inch stick and tie and ends then fry, delicious! with white cheese or any kind of cheese you have in hand... And Arepas have origins from Indians in Venezuela and Colombia, so no fighting about that!Lisseth / flag if inappropriate I finally made these yesterday and they turned out amazing. The first batch I made. I ate them with strawberry jam. The second batch I stuffed with chicken and a mustard sauce I made. It was so good!sakiera423 / flag if inappropriate I am Colombian and very surprised to hear from a Venezuelan person that arepas are from Venezuela, wrong, they are from COLOMBIA too, we eat them in a different way but we used to eat arepas before going to school in the morning with eggs and coffee, Colombians still eat that way. The recipe is correct but I don\\'t think you need to put any oil in the dough. Colombians arepas are the best. Venezuelans are good too.marta18 from San Ramon, California / flag if inappropriate I\\'ve made arepas a number of times starting from this recipe using a few different kinds of cheese including mozzerella, cheddar and queso fresco. I often substitute milk for part of the water and typically fry the arepas. For filling pulled pork is traditional and I\\'ve also done pulled chicken or chorizo, onions and hot peppers or black beans with cilantro and chipotle. The recipe has a great deal of give to it and is easily customizable. Arepa flour is often labelled \\'masarepa\\' and goya among others makes it and sells it in supermarkets.tuckerp from Somerville, MA / flag if inappropriate My first try at arepas and they were easier than I thought they\\'d be. I didn\\'t have ricotta salata or mozz around so I grated some feta into it and it worked really well. I served it with a sweet potato, black bean and salsa mix and a bit of sour cream and squeeze of lime. They were delish. I will absolutely make them again. I love the crispy texture that they add to the mix. Carolina_Bumblina / flag if inappropriate Actually historically the arepa can me tranced back to native Indians in La Grab Colombia prediminately in the areas of the Andes that are in Colombia. The arepas can be made and eaten many different ways, not just stuffed. Traditionally it was made to accompany the meal. I love it and have eaten it since I was born. You don\\'t need oil just water, the masa de arepa or arepa flour. Go to any local grocery store and in the Latino isle look for the Goya Masa de Arepa. It\\'s yellow bag and it has made in Colombia on the back. Just follow the instructions and enjoy!Proud Colombian Cook from Bogotá, Colombia / flag if inappropriate Use Arepa Flour, Corn meal doesn\\'t work. You need beef, chicken, cheese or any other ingredient to stuff the arepas. And.... Arepas are originally Venezuelan.. Thanks Venezuelan Freedom / flag if inappropriate To the reviewer that rated the recipe with one fork...... The mistake was to use corn meal (DO NEVER USE CORN MEAL) It is not the same as arepa flour. Arepa flour can be purchased at many supermarkets now a days, but if you don\\'t find it there try small latin stores. A Cook from Venezuela / flag if inappropriate You are not supposed eat arepas plain, that is why they don\\'t have a whole lot of flavor. The way we make them back home is to just mix the corn flour with salt and water. Then form them into discs and fry just like this recipe. Then when they are golden brown, let the oil drain for a bit, then cut the arepa almost in half and spoon out some of the uncooked dough in the middle. Then you can stuff it with anything. (cheese, pork, beef, and/or shrimp are most popular) The arepa is pretty much the bread that you use to make a sandwich. So stuff it with anything that sounds good to you. It will be good no matter what you put in it.euphoria320 from Caracas, VE / flag if inappropriate You can also try instead of frying, kind of roasted in middle heat using a goo skillet, do not forced to flip until cook on one side, once both sides are cook, not burn, you can fill them with almost anything, I like mozzarella cheese and jam,,I put the cheese first, back on the heat,,to let it melt,,anything goes,,Go easy on the salt, some of the stuff you might use for filling might be salty.... Good apetitejosegran from I´m Colombian born, raised in Florida / flag if inappropriate Very simple and delicious. I used an electric arepa maker that I just purchased. Suprisingly, it was worth the purchase. To the reviewer that didn\\'t follow the recipe and rated it with one fork, give the recipe another try with the correct ingredients and you will surely have better luck. One fork and didn\\'t follow the recipe doesn\\'t make sensechefnina11 / flag if inappropriate I was going to give them three forks, but then I saw that one reviewer totally ignored the directions and gave the results one fork, as if that was somehow the recipe\\'s fault. So the fourth fork is to offset the other review. A Cook from Virginia / flag if inappropriate Very easy and delicious. I used cojita cheese as that was what was available at my market and it looked quite similar to crumbled ricotta salata. I sprinkled them with a little salt once they came out of the pan. Also pretty good reheated the next day in the toaster oven. Plan to make for a party.slowfoodgrrl from Minneapolis / flag if inappropriate I used regular cornmeal and the mozzarella option and they turned out terrible. They wouldn\\'t stick together so I added egg. Bad idea!Basically they became flat, flavorless, fried corn muffins. I couldn\\'t taste the cheese at all. Will try authentic arepa flour and the ricotta option....maybe it will be better.krysta from Phoenix, AZ / flag if inappropriate I thought this was a very nice recipe, very easy. although it could use a little more flavor, i was very content with how it turned out Mar_bair from Wisconsin / flag if inappropriate Delicious and oh so easy! I have made this four times now. With a nice green salad on the side, it\\'s a nice supper. On its own, it makes a great party dish.

       "        {'text': 'Thermistor From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search Thermistor Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor, bead type, insulated wires Type Passive Working principle Electric resistance Electronic symbolsymbol A thermistor is a type of resistor whose resistance is dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as inrush current limiters, temperature sensors (negative temperature coefficient or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (positive temperature coefficient or PTC type typically). Thermistors are of two opposite fundamental types: With NTC thermistors, resistance decreases as temperature rises. An NTC is commonly used as a temperature sensor, or in series with a circuit as an inrush current limiter. With PTC thermistors, resistance increases as temperature rises. PTC thermistors are commonly installed in series with a circuit, and used to protect against overcurrent conditions, as resettable fuses. Thermistors differ from resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) in that the material used in a thermistor is generally a ceramic or polymer, while RTDs use pure metals. The thermistors are in the form of beads, rods and discs but RTDs are in different shapes and sizes. The temperature response is also different; RTDs are useful over larger temperature ranges, while thermistors typically achieve a greater precision within a limited temperature range, typically −90 °C to 130 °C. [1]Contents [ hide ]1 Basic operation2 Steinhart–Hart equation3 B or β parameter equation4 Conduction model4.1 NTC (negative temperature coefficient)4.2 PTC (positive temperature coefficient)5 Self-heating effects6 Applications6.1 PTC6.2 NTC7 History8 See also9 References10 External links Basic operation [ edit]Assuming, as a first-order approximation, that the relationship between resistance and temperature is linear, then:where, change in resistance, change in temperature, first-order temperature coefficient of resistance Thermistors can be classified into two types, depending on the classification of. If is positive, the resistance increases with increasing temperature, and the device is called a positive temperature coefficient ( PTC) thermistor, or posistor. If is negative, the resistance decreases with increasing temperature, and the device is called a negative temperature coefficient ( NTC) thermistor. Resistors that are not thermistors are designed to have a as close to 0 as possible, so that their resistance remains nearly constant over a wide temperature range. Instead of the temperature coefficient k, sometimes the temperature coefficient of resistance (alpha sub T) is used. It is defined as [2]This coefficient should not be confused with the parameter below. Steinhart–Hart equation [ edit]Main article: Steinhart–Hart equation In practice, the linear approximation (above) works only over a small temperature range. For accurate temperature measurements, the resistance/temperature curve of the device must be described in more detail. The Steinhart–Hart equation is a widely used third-order approximation:where a, b and c are called the Steinhart–Hart parameters, and must be specified for each device. T is the absolute temperature and R is the resistance. To give resistance as a function of temperature, the above can be rearranged into:whereyx The error in the Steinhart–Hart equation is generally less than 0.02 °C in the measurement of temperature over a 200 °C range. [3] As an example, typical values for a thermistor with a resistance of 3 kΩ at room temperature (25 °C = 298.15 K) are:a 1.40b 2.37c 9.90B or β parameter equation [ edit]NTC thermistors can also be characterised with the B (or β) parameter equation, which is essentially the Steinhart–Hart equation with, and,where the temperatures are in kelvins, and R 0 is the resistance at temperature T 0 (25 °C = 298.15 K). Solving for R yields:or, alternatively,where. This can be solved for the temperature: The B-parameter equation can also be written as. This can be used to convert the function of resistance vs. temperature of a thermistor into a linear function of vs.. The average slope of this function will then yield an estimate of the value of the B parameter. Conduction model [ edit]NTC (negative temperature coefficient) [ edit]A failed (blown) NTC thermistor that worked as an inrush current limiter in a switched-mode power supply. The most likely cause of failure was overload caused by engineering failure (the part was constantly subjected to a higher load than what it was designed for)Many NTC thermistors are made from a pressed disc, rod, plate, bead or cast chip of semiconducting material such as sintered metal oxides. They work because raising the temperature of a semiconductor increases the number of active charge carriers - it promotes them into the conduction band. The more charge carriers that are available, the more current a material can conduct. In certain materials like ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) with titanium (Ti) doping an n-type semiconductor is formed and the charge carriers are electrons. In materials such as nickel oxide (Ni O) with lithium (Li) doping a p-type semiconductor is created where holes are the charge carriers. [4]This is described in the formula:= electric current (amperes) = density of charge carriers (count/m³) = cross-sectional area of the material (m²) = drift velocity of electrons (m/s) = charge of an electron ( coulomb)Over large changes in temperature, calibration is necessary. Over small changes in temperature, if the right semiconductor is used, the resistance of the material is linearly proportional to the temperature. There are many different semiconducting thermistors with a range from about 0.01 kelvin to 2,000 kelvins (−273.14 °C to 1,700 °C). [ citation needed]The IEC standard symbol for a NTC thermistor includes a \"-t°\" under the rectangle. [5]PTC (positive temperature coefficient) [ edit]Most PTC thermistors are made from doped polycrystalline ceramic (containing barium titanate (Ba Ti O 3) and other compounds) which have the property that their resistance rises suddenly at a certain critical temperature. Barium titanate is ferroelectric and its dielectric constant varies with temperature. Below the Curie point temperature, the high dielectric constant prevents the formation of potential barriers between the crystal grains, leading to a low resistance. In this region the device has a small negative temperature coefficient. At the Curie point temperature, the dielectric constant drops sufficiently to allow the formation of potential barriers at the grain boundaries, and the resistance increases sharply with temperature. At even higher temperatures, the material reverts to NTC behaviour. Another type of thermistor is a silistor, a thermally sensitive silicon resistor. Silistors employ silicon as the semiconductive component material. Unlike ceramic PTC thermistors, silistors have an almost linear resistance-temperature characteristic. [6]Barium titanate thermistors can be used as self-controlled heaters; for a given voltage, the ceramic will heat to a certain temperature, but the power used will depend on the heat loss from the ceramic. The dynamics of PTC thermistors being powered also is extremely useful. When first connected to a voltage source, a large current corresponding to the low, cold, resistance flows, but as the thermistor self-heats, the current is reduced until a limiting current (and corresponding peak device temperature) is reached. The current-limiting effect can replace fuses. They are also used in the degaussing circuits of many CRT monitors and televisions where the degaussing coil only has to be connected in series with an appropriately chosen thermistor; a particular advantage is that the current decrease is smooth, producing optimum degausing effect. Improved degaussing circuits have auxiliary heating elements to heat the thermistor further (and reduce the final current) or timed relays to disconnect the degaussing circuit entirely after it has operated. Another type of PTC thermistor is the polymer PTC, which is sold under brand names such as \" Polyswitch \" \"Semifuse\", and \"Multifuse\". This consists of plastic with carbon grains embedded in it. When the plastic is cool, the carbon grains are all in contact with each other, forming a conductive path through the device. When the plastic heats up, it expands, forcing the carbon grains apart, and causing the resistance of the device to rise, which then causes increased heating and rapid resistance increase. Like the Ba Ti O 3 thermistor, this device has a highly nonlinear resistance/temperature response useful for thermal or circuit control, not for temperature measurement. Besides circuit elements used to limit current, self-limiting heaters can be made in the form of wires or strips, useful for heat tracing. PTC thermistors \\'latch\\' into a hot / high resistance state: once hot, they stay in that high resistance state, until cooled. In fact, Neil A Downie showed how you can use the effect as a simple latch/memory circuit, the effect being enhanced by using two PTC thermistors in series, with thermistor A cool, thermistor B hot, or vice versa. [7]The IEC standard symbol for a PTC thermistor includes a \"+t°\" under the rectangle. [8]Self-heating effects [ edit]When a current flows through a thermistor, it will generate heat which will raise the temperature of the thermistor above that of its environment. If the thermistor is being used to measure the temperature of the environment, this electrical heating may introduce a significant error if a correction is not made. Alternatively, this effect itself can be exploited. It can, for example, make a sensitive air-flow device employed in a sailplane rate-of-climb instrument, the electronic variometer, or serve as a timer for a relay as was formerly done in telephone exchanges. The electrical power input to the thermistor is just:where I is current and V is the voltage drop across the thermistor. This power is converted to heat, and this heat energy is transferred to the surrounding environment. The rate of transfer is well described by Newton\\'s law of cooling:where T (R) is the temperature of the thermistor as a function of its resistance R, is the temperature of the surroundings, and K is the dissipation constant, usually expressed in units of milliwatts per degree Celsius. At equilibrium, the two rates must be equal. The current and voltage across the thermistor will depend on the particular circuit configuration. As a simple example, if the voltage across the thermistor is held fixed, then by Ohm\\'s Law we have and the equilibrium equation can be solved for the ambient temperature as a function of the measured resistance of the thermistor: The dissipation constant is a measure of the thermal connection of the thermistor to its surroundings. It is generally given for the thermistor in still air, and in well-stirred oil. Typical values for a small glass bead thermistor are 1.5 m W/°C in still air and 6.0 m W/°C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a thermistor may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the thermistor may be used as a flow rate sensor, since the dissipation constant increases with the rate of flow of a fluid past the thermistor. The power dissipated in a thermistor is typically maintained at a very low level to ensure insignificant temperature measurement error due to self heating. However, some thermistor applications depend upon significant \"self heating\" to raise the body temperature of the thermistor well above the ambient temperature so the sensor then detects even subtle changes in the thermal conductivity of the environment. Some of these applications include liquid level detection, liquid flow measurement and air flow measurement. [2]Applications [ edit]This section needs additional citations for verification.

(June 2013) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)PTC [ edit]As current-limiting devices for circuit protection, as replacements for fuses. Current through the device causes a small amount of resistive heating. If the current is large enough to generate more heat than the device can lose to its surroundings, the device heats up, causing its resistance to increase. This creates a self-reinforcing effect that drives the resistance upwards, therefore limiting the current. As timers in the degaussing coil circuit of most CRT displays. When the display unit is initially switched on, current flows through the thermistor and degaussing coil. The coil and thermistor are intentionally sized so that the current flow will heat the thermistor to the point that the degaussing coil shuts off in under a second. For effective degaussing, it is necessary that the magnitude of the alternating magnetic field produced by the degaussing coil decreases smoothly and continuously, rather than sharply switching off or decreasing in steps; the PTC thermistor accomplishes this naturally as it heats up. A degaussing circuit using a PTC thermistor is simple, reliable (for its simplicity), and inexpensive. As heater in automotive industry to provide additional heat inside cabin with diesel engine or to heat diesel in cold climatic conditions before engine injection. In temperature compensated synthesizer voltage controlled oscillators. [9]In lithium battery protection circuits. [10]In an electrically actuated Wax motor to provide the heat necessary to expand the wax. Many electric motors and dry type power transformers incorporate PTC thermistors in their windings. When used in conjunction with a monitoring relay they provide overtemperature protection to prevent insulation damage. The equipment manufacturer selects a thermistor with a highly non-linear response curve where resistance increases dramatically at the maximum allowable winding temperature, causing the relay to operate. NTC [ edit]As a resistance thermometer for low-temperature measurements of the order of 10 K. As an inrush current limiter device in power supply circuits, they present a higher resistance initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on, and then heat up and become much lower resistance to allow higher current flow during normal operation. These thermistors are usually much larger than measuring type thermistors, and are purposely designed for this application. [11]As sensors in automotive applications to monitor fluid temperatures like the engine coolant, cabin air, external air or engine oil temperature, and feed the relative readings to control units like the ECU and to the dashboard. To monitor the temperature of an incubator. Thermistors are also commonly used in modern digital thermostats and to monitor the temperature of battery packs while charging. Thermistors are often used in the hot ends of 3D printers; they monitor the heat produced and allow the printer\\'s control circuitry to keep a constant temperature for melting the plastic filament. In the food handling and processing industry, especially for food storage systems and food preparation. Maintaining the correct temperature is critical to prevent foodborne illness. Throughout the consumer appliance industry for measuring temperature. Toasters, coffee makers, refrigerators, freezers, hair dryers, etc. all rely on thermistors for proper temperature control. NTC thermistors come in bare and lugged forms, the former is for point sensing to achieve high accuracy for specific points, such as laser diode die, etc. [12]For measurement of temperature profile inside the sealed cavity of a convective (thermal) inertial sensor [13]. History [ edit]The first NTC thermistor was discovered in 1833 by Michael Faraday, who reported on the semiconducting behavior of silver sulfide. Faraday noticed that the resistance of silver sulfide decreased dramatically as temperature increased. (This was also the first documented observation of a semiconducting material.) [14]Because early thermistors were difficult to produce and applications for the technology were limited, commercial production of thermistors did not begin until the 1930s. [15] A commercially viable thermistor was invented by Samuel Ruben in 1930. [16]See also [ edit]Iron-hydrogen resistor Thermocouple References [ edit]^ \"NTC Thermistors\".

       "        {'text': 'The Intransitive Verb Printer Fabulous!The Intransitive Verb Recognize an intransitive verb when you see one. An intransitive verb has two characteristics. First, it is an action verb, expressing a doable activity like arrive, go , lie, sneeze , sit, die, etc. Second, unlike a transitive verb, it will not have a direct object receiving the action. Here are some examples of intransitive verbs: Huffing and puffing, we arrived at the classroom door with only seven seconds to spare. Arrived = intransitive verb. James went to the campus cafe for a steaming bowl of squid eyeball stew. Went = intransitive verb. To escape the midday sun, the cats lie in the shade under our cars. Lie = intransitive verb. Around fresh ground pepper, Sheryl sneezes with violence. Sneezes = intransitive verb. In the evenings, Glenda sits on the front porch to admire her immaculate lawn. Sits = intransitive verb. Flipped on its back, the beetle that Clara soaked with insecticide dies under the refrigerator. Dies = intransitive verb. Realize that many verbs can be both transitive and intransitive. An action verb with a direct object is transitive while an action verb with no direct object is intransitive. Some verbs, such as arrive, go , lie, sneeze , sit, and die, are always intransitive; it is impossible for a direct object to follow. Other action verbs, however, can be transitive or intransitive, depending on what follows in the sentence. Compare these examples: Because of blood sugar problems, Rosa always eats before leaving for school. Eats = intransitive verb. If there is no leftover pizza, Rosa usually eats whole-grain cereal. Eats = transitive verb; cereal = direct object. During cross-country practice, Damien runs over hills, through fields, across the river, and along the highway. Runs = intransitive verb. In the spring, Damien will run his first marathon. Will run = transitive verb; marathon = direct object.

[1] Cooperatives may include:non-profit community organizationsbusinesses owned and managed by the people who use their services (a consumer cooperative)organisations managed by the people who work there ( worker cooperatives)organisations managed by the people to whom they provide accommodation ( housing cooperatives)hybrids such as worker cooperatives that are also consumer cooperatives or credit unionsmulti-stakeholder cooperatives such as those that bring together civil society and local actors to deliver community needssecond- and third-tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives Research published by the Worldwatch Institute found that in 2012 approximately one billion people in 96 countries had become members of at least one cooperative. [2] The turnover of the largest three hundred cooperatives in the world reached $2.2 trillion – which, if they were to be a country, it would make them the seventh largest. [3] [ need quotation to verify]One dictionary defines a cooperative as \"a jointly owned enterprise engaging in the production or distribution of goods or the supplying of services, operated by its members for their mutual benefit, typically organized by consumers or farmers\". [4] Cooperative businesses are typically more economically resilient than many other forms of enterprise, with twice the number of co-operatives (80%) surviving their first five years compared with other business ownership models (41%). [5] Cooperatives frequently have social goals which they aim to accomplish by investing a proportion of trading profits back into their communities. As an example of this, in 2013, retail co-operatives in the UK invested 6.9% of their pre-tax profits in the communities in which they trade as compared with 2.4% for other rival supermarkets. [6]The International Co-operative Alliance was the first international association formed (1895) by the cooperative movement. [ citation needed] It includes the World Council of Credit Unions. A second organization formed later in Germany: the International Raiffeisen Union. In the United States, the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA CLUSA; the abbreviation of the organization retains the initials of its former name, Cooperative League of the USA) serves as the sector \\'s oldest national membership association. It is dedicated to ensuring that cooperative businesses have the same opportunities as other businesses operating in the country and that consumers have access to cooperatives in the marketplace. A U. S. National Cooperative Bank formed in the 1970s. [7] By 2004 a new association focused on worker co-ops was founded, the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives. Since 2002 cooperatives and credit unions could be distinguished on the Internet by use of a .coop domain. Since 2014, following International Cooperative Alliance\\'s introduction of the Cooperative Marque, ICA cooperatives and WOCCU credit unions can also be identified by a coop ethical consumerism label.

Tribes were organized as cooperative structures, allocating jobs and resources among each other, only trading with the external communities. [ citation needed] In alpine environments, trade could only be maintained in organized cooperatives to achieve a useful condition of artificial roads such as Viamala in 1472. [8] Pre-industrial Europe is home to the first cooperatives from an industrial context. [9]Robert Owen (1771–1858) was a social reformer and a pioneer of the cooperative movement. In 1761, the Fenwick Weavers\\' Society was formed in Fenwick, East Ayrshire, Scotland to sell discounted oatmeal to local workers. [10] Its services expanded to include assistance with savings and loans, emigration and education. In 1810, Welshsocial reformer Robert Owen, from Newtown in mid- Wales, and his partners purchased New Lanark mill from Owen\\'s father-in-law David Dale and proceeded to introduce better labour standards including discounted retail shops where profits were passed on to his employees. Owen left New Lanark to pursue other forms of cooperative organization and develop coop ideas through writing and lecture. Cooperative communities were set up in Glasgow, Indiana and Hampshire, although ultimately unsuccessful. In 1828, William King set up a newspaper, The Cooperator, to promote Owen\\'s thinking, having already set up a cooperative store in Brighton. [11] [12]The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, (RCEP) founded in 1844, is usually considered the first successful cooperative enterprise, used as a model for modern coops, following the \\' Rochdale Principles \\'. A group of 28 weavers and other artisans in Rochdale, England set up the society to open their own store selling food items they could not otherwise afford. Within ten years there were over a thousand cooperative societies in the United Kingdom. [ citation needed]Other events such as the founding of a friendly society by the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1832 were key occasions in the creation of organized labor and consumer movements. [13]Social economy [ edit]Cooperatives traditionally combine social benefit interests with capitalistic property-right interests. Cooperatives achieve a mix of social and capital purposes by democratically governing distribution questions by and between equal by not controlling members. Democratic oversight of decisions to equitably distribute assets and other benefits means capital ownership is arranged in a way for social benefit inside the organization. External societal benefit is also encouraged by incorporating the operating-principle of cooperation between co-operatives. In the final year of the 20th century, cooperatives banded together to establish a number of social enterprise agencies which have moved to adopt the multi-stakeholder cooperative model. In the years 1994–2009 the EU and its member nations gradually revised national accounting systems to \"make visible\" the increasing contribution of social economy organizations. [14]Organizational and ideological roots [ edit]The roots of the cooperative movement can be traced to multiple influences and extend worldwide. In the English-speaking world, post- feudal forms of cooperation between workers and owners that are expressed today as \"profit-sharing\" and \"surplus sharing\" arrangements, existed as far back as 1795. [15] The key ideological influence on the Anglosphere branch of the cooperative movement, however, was a rejection of the charity principles that underpinned welfare reforms when the British government radically revised its Poor Laws in 1834. As both state and church institutions began to routinely distinguish between the \\'deserving\\' and \\'undeserving\\' poor, a movement of friendly societies grew throughout the British Empire based on the principle of mutuality, committed to self-help in the welfare of working people. [ citation needed]Friendly Societies established forums through which one member, one vote was practiced in organisation decision-making. The principles challenged the idea that a person should be an owner of property before being granted a political voice. Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century (and then repeatedly every twenty years or so) there was a surge in the number of cooperative organisations, both in commercial practice and civil society, operating to advance democracy and universal suffrage as a political principle. [16] Friendly Societies and consumer cooperatives became the dominant form of organization amongst working people in Anglosphere industrial societies prior to the rise of trade unions and industrial factories. Weinbren reports that by the end of the 19th century, over 80% of British working age men and 90% of Australian working age men were members of one or more Friendly Society. [17]From the mid-nineteenth century, mutual organisations embraced these ideas in economic enterprises, firstly amongst tradespeople, and later in cooperative stores, educational institutes, financial institutions and industrial enterprises. The common thread (enacted in different ways, and subject to the constraints of various systems of national law) is the principle that an enterprise or association should be owned and controlled by the people it serves, and share any surpluses on the basis of each member\\'s cooperative contribution (as a producer, labourer or consumer) rather than their capacity to invest financial capital. [18]The cooperative movement has been fueled globally by ideas of economic democracy. Economic democracy is a socioeconomic philosophy that suggests an expansion of decision-making power from a small minority of corporate shareholders to a larger majority of public stakeholders. There are many different approaches to thinking about and building economic democracy. Anarchists are committed to libertarian socialism and have focused on local organization, including locally managed cooperatives, linked through confederations of unions, cooperatives and communities. Marxists, who as socialists have likewise held and worked for the goal of democratizing productive and reproductive relationships, often placed a greater strategic emphasis on confronting the larger scales of human organization. As they viewed the capitalist class to be politically, militarily and culturally mobilized for the purpose of maintaining an exploitable working class, they fought in the early 20th century to appropriate from the capitalist class the society\\'s collective political capacity in the form of the state, either through democratic socialism, or through what came to be known as Leninism. Though they regard the state as an unnecessarily oppressive institution, Marxists considered appropriating national and international-scale capitalist institutions and resources (such as the state) to be an important first pillar in creating conditions favorable to solidaristic economies. [19] [20] With the declining influence of the USSR after the 1960s, socialist strategies pluralized, though economic democratizers have not as yet established a fundamental challenge to the hegemony of global neoliberal capitalism. Meaning [ edit]Cooperatives as legal entities [ edit]A cooperative is a legal entity owned and democratically controlled by its members. Members often have a close association with the enterprise as producers or consumers of its products or services, or as its employees. [21]There are specific forms of incorporation for cooperatives in some countries, e.g. Finland [22] and Australia. [23] Cooperatives may take the form of companies limited by shares or by guarantee, partnerships or unincorporated associations. In the UK they may also use the industrial and provident society structure. In the US, cooperatives are often organized as non-capital stock corporations under state-specific cooperative laws. However, they may also be unincorporated associations or business corporations such as limited liability companies or partnerships; such forms are useful when the members want to allow [ citation needed]:some members to have a greater share of the control, orsome investors to have a return on their capital that exceeds fixed interest,neither of which may be allowed under local laws for cooperatives. Cooperatives often share their earnings with the membership as dividends, which are divided among the members according to their participation in the enterprise, such as patronage, instead of according to the value of their capital shareholdings (as is done by a joint stock company ). Identity [ edit]Coop Marque and domain [ edit]Since 2002, ICA cooperatives and WOCCU credit unions could be distinguished by use of a .coop domain. In 2014, ICA introduced the Global Cooperative Marque [24] for use by ICA\\'s [25] Cooperative members and by WOCCU\\'s Credit Union members so they can be further identified [26] by their coop ethical consumerism label. The marque is used today by thousands of cooperatives in more than a hundred countries. [27]The .coop domain and Co-operative Marque were designed as a new symbol of the global cooperative movement and its collective identity in the digital age. The domain and coop marque differentiates coop products and e-services offerings of the Movement from all other forms of business, both investor-owned and privately owned businesses. It specifically recognises its rapidly changing role in society, marked by the emergence of the digital cooperative. The .coop (dot coop) domain and a global Co-operative Marque are open for use within all types of ICA cooperatives and WOCCU credit unions on their products or digital services, in combination with individual cooperative\\'s own labels. The Co-operative Marque and domain is reserved just for co-operatives, credit unions and organisations that support co-operatives; is distinguished by its ethical badge that subscribes to the seven ICA Cooperative Principles and Co-op Values. Co-ops can be identified on the Internet through the use of the .coop suffix of internet addresses. Organizations using .coop domain names must adhere to the basic co-op values. Coop principles and values [ edit]Cooperative principles are the seven guidelines by which coops put their values into practice, often called the seven Rochdale Principles: [28]Voluntary and open membership Democratic member control Economic participation by members Autonomy and independence Education, training and information Cooperation among cooperatives Concern for community Cooperatives values, in the tradition of its founders, are based on \"self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity.\" Co-operative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others. Legal [ edit]Such legal entities have a range of social characteristics. Membership is open, meaning that anyone who satisfies certain non-discriminatory conditions may join. Economic benefits are distributed proportionally to each member\\'s level of participation in the cooperative, for instance, by a dividend on sales or purchases, rather than according to capital invested. [29] Cooperatives may be classified as either worker, consumer, producer, purchasing or housing cooperatives. [30] They are distinguished from other forms of incorporation in that profit-making or economic stability are balanced by the interests of the community. [29]The United Nations declared 2012 to be the International Year of Cooperatives (IYC). [31]Economic stability [ edit]Main article: Economic stability Capital and the Debt Trap reports that \"cooperatives tend to have a longer life than other types of enterprise, and thus a higher level of entrepreneurial sustainability\". This resilience has been attributed to how cooperatives share risks and rewards between members, how they harness the ideas of many and how members have a tangible ownership stake in the business. Additionally, \"cooperative banks build up counter-cyclical buffers that function well in case of a crisis,\" and are less likely to lead members and clients towards a debt trap (p. 216). This is explained by their more democratic governance that reduces perverse incentives and subsequent contributions to economic bubbles. In the United Kingdom [ edit]A 2013 report published by the UK Office for National Statistics showed that in the UK the rate of survival of cooperatives after five years was 80 percent compared with only 41 percent for all other enterprises. [5] A further study found that after ten years 44 percent of cooperatives were still in operation, compared with only 20 percent for all enterprises. Other countries in Europe [ edit]A 2012 report published by The European Confederation of cooperatives and worker-owned enterprises active in industry and services showed that in France and Spain, worker cooperatives and social cooperatives “have been more resilient than conventional enterprises during the economic crisis”. [32]In Canada [ edit]A 2010 report by the Ministry of Economic Development, Innovation and Export in Québec found that the five-year survival rate and 10-year survival rate of cooperatives in Québec to be 62% and 44% respectively compared to 35% and 20% for conventional firms. [33] Another report by the BC-Alberta Social economy Research Alliance found that the three-year survival rate of cooperatives in Alberta to be 81.5% in comparison to 48% for traditional firms. [34] Another report by the aforementioned Research Alliance found that in British-Columbia, the 5-year survival rates for cooperatives between 2000 and 2010 to be 66.6% in comparison to conventional businesses that had 43% and 39% in the years 1984 and 1993 respectively [34]In the United States of America [ edit]In a 2007 study by the World Council of Credit Unions, the 5-year survival rate of cooperatives in the United States was found to be 90% in comparison to 3-5% for traditional businesses. [35]Types of cooperatives [ edit]Non-monetary cooperative [ edit]A non-monetary cooperative provides a service based on entirely voluntary labour in the maintenance and provision of a particular service or good, working in the identical manner of a library. These co-ops are locally owned and operated and provides the free rental of equipments of all kinds (bicycles, sports, gear). This idea has been said to reduce general human consumption of goods, a key subject in sustainable development. [ citation needed]Retailers\\' cooperative [ edit]Main article: Retailers\\' cooperative A retailers\\' cooperative (known as a secondary or marketing cooperative in some countries) is an organization which employs economies of scale on behalf of its members to receive discounts from manufacturers and to pool marketing. It is common for locally owned grocery stores, hardware stores and pharmacies. In this case, the members of the cooperative are businesses rather than individuals. The Best Western international hotel chain is actually a retailers\\' cooperative, whose members are hotel operators, although it refers to itself as a \"nonprofit membership association.\" It gave up on the \"cooperative\" label after some courts insisted on enforcing regulatory requirements for franchisors despite its member-controlled status. Worker cooperative [ edit]Main article: Worker cooperative A worker cooperative or producer cooperative is a cooperative, that is owned and democratically controlled by its \"worker-owners\". There are no outside owners in a \"pure\" workers\\' cooperative, only the workers own shares of the business, though hybrid forms exist in which consumers, community members or capitalist investors also own some shares. In practice, control by worker-owners may be exercised through individual, collective or majority ownership by the workforce, or the retention of individual, collective or majority voting rights (exercised on a one-member one-vote basis). A worker cooperative, therefore, has the characteristic that the majority of its workforce owns shares, and the majority of shares are owned by the workforce. Membership is not always compulsory for employees, but generally only employees can become members either directly (as shareholders) or indirectly through membership of a trust that owns the company. The impact of political ideology on practice constrains the development of cooperatives in different countries. In India, there is a form of workers\\' cooperative which insists on compulsory membership for all employees and compulsory employment for all members. That is the form of the Indian Coffee Houses. This system was advocated by the Indian communist leader A. K. Gopalan. In places like the UK, common ownership (indivisible collective ownership) was popular in the 1970s. Cooperative Societies only became legal in Britain after the passing of Slaney\\'s Act in 1852. In 1865 there were 651 registered societies with a total membership of well over 200,000. There are now more than 400 worker cooperatives in the UK, Suma Wholefoods being the largest example with a turnover of £24 million. Volunteer cooperative [ edit]A volunteer cooperative is a cooperative that is run by and for a network of volunteers, for the benefit of a defined membership or the general public, to achieve some goal. Depending on the structure, it may be a collective or mutual organization, which is operated according to the principles of cooperative governance. The most basic form of volunteer-run cooperative is a voluntary association. A lodge or social club may be organized on this basis. A volunteer-run co-op is distinguished from a worker cooperative in that the latter is by definition employee-owned, whereas the volunteer cooperative is typically a non-stock corporation, volunteer-run consumer co-op or service organization, in which workers and beneficiaries jointly participate in management decisions and receive discounts on the basis of sweat equity. Social cooperative [ edit]Main article: Social cooperative A particularly successful form of multi-stakeholder cooperative is the Italian \"social cooperative\", of which some 11,000 exist. [36] \"Type A\" social cooperatives bring together providers and beneficiaries of a social service as members. \"Type B\" social cooperatives bring together permanent workers and previously unemployed people who wish to integrate into the labor market. They are legally defined as follows:no more than 80% of profits may be distributed, interest is limited to the bond rate and dissolution is altruistic (assets may not be distributed)the cooperative has legal personality and limited liabilitythe objective is the general benefit of the community and the social integration of citizensthose of type B integrate disadvantaged people into the labour market. The categories of disadvantage they target may include physical and mental disability, drug and alcohol addiction, developmental disorders and problems with the law. They do not include other factors of disadvantage such as unemployment, race, sexual orientation or abuse.type A cooperatives provide health, social or educational servicesvarious categories of stakeholder may become members, including paid employees, beneficiaries, volunteers (up to 50% of members), financial investors and public institutions. In type B cooperatives at least 30% of the members must be from the disadvantaged target groupsvoting is one person one vote Consumers\\' cooperative [ edit]Main article: Consumers\\' cooperative A consumers\\' cooperative is a business owned by its customers. Employees can also generally become members. Members vote on major decisions and elect the board of directors from among their own number. The first of these was set up in 1844 in the North-West of England by 28 weavers who wanted to sell food at a lower price than the local shops. The world\\'s largest consumers\\' cooperative is the Co-operative Group in the United Kingdom, which offers a variety of retail and financial services. The UK also has a number of autonomous consumers\\' cooperative societies, such as the East of England Co-operative Society and Midcounties Co-operative. In fact, the Co-operative Group is something of a hybrid, having both corporate members (mostly other consumers\\' cooperatives, as a result of its origins as a wholesale society ), and individual retail consumer members. [ citation needed]Business and employment cooperative [ edit]Main article: Business and employment co-operative Business and employment cooperatives (BECs) are a subset of worker cooperatives that represent a new approach to providing support to the creation of new businesses. Like other business creation support schemes, BEC\\'s enable budding entrepreneurs to experiment with their business idea while benefiting from a secure income. The innovation BECs introduce is that once the business is established the entrepreneur is not forced to leave and set up independently, but can stay and become a full member of the cooperative. The micro-enterprises then combine to form one multi-activity enterprise whose members provide a mutually supportive environment for each other. BECs thus provide budding business people with an easy transition from inactivity to self-employment, but in a collective framework. They open up new horizons for people who have ambition but who lack the skills or confidence needed to set off entirely on their own – or who simply want to carry on an independent economic activity but within a supportive group context. New generation cooperative [ edit]New generation cooperatives (NGCs) are an adaptation of traditional cooperative structures to modern, capital intensive industries. They are sometimes described as a hybrid between traditional co-ops and limited liability companies or public benefit corporations. They were first developed in California and spread and flourished in the US Mid-West in the 1990s. [37] They are now common in Canada where they operate primarily in agriculture and food services, where their primary purpose is to add value to primary products. For example, producing ethanol from corn, pasta from durum wheat, or gourmet cheese from goat’s milk. A representative example of an operating NGC is the Fourth Estate (association), a multi-stakeholder NGC journalism association. Types and number of cooperatives [ edit]Co-op City in The Bronx, New York City is the largest cooperative housing development in the world, with 55,000 people. [38]The two largest supermarkets chains in Switzerland, Migros and Coop, are cooperatives. The third largest bank, Raiffeisen, is a cooperative as well. The top 300 largest cooperatives were listed in 2007 by the International Co-operative Alliance. 80% were involved in either agriculture, finance, or retail and more than half were in the United States, Italy, or France. In the United States, cooperatives, particularly those in the Midwest, are analyzed at the University of Wisconsin Center for Cooperatives. Housing cooperative [ edit]Main articles: Housing cooperative and Building cooperative A housing cooperative is a legal mechanism for ownership of housing where residents either own shares (share capital co-op) reflecting their equity in the cooperative\\'s real estate, or have membership and occupancy rights in a not-for-profit cooperative (non-share capital co-op), and they underwrite their housing through paying subscriptions or rent. Housing cooperatives come in three basic equity structures In market-rate housing cooperatives, members may sell their shares in the cooperative whenever they like for whatever price the market will bear, much like any other residential property. Market-rate co-ops are very common in New York City. Limited equity housing cooperatives, which are often used by affordable housing developers, allow members to own some equity in their home, but limit the sale price of their membership share to that which they paid. Group equity or zero-equity housing cooperatives do not allow members to own equity in their residences and often have rental agreements well below market rates. Members of a building cooperative (in Britain known as a self-build housing cooperative) pool resources to build housing, normally using a high proportion of their own labor. When the building is finished, each member is the sole owner of a homestead, and the cooperative may be dissolved. This collective effort was at the origin of many of Britain\\'s building societies, which however, developed into \"permanent\" mutual savings and loan organisations, a term which persisted in some of their names (such as the former Leeds Permanent ). Nowadays such self-building may be financed using a step-by-step mortgage which is released in stages as the building is completed. The term may also refer to worker cooperatives in the building trade. Utility cooperative [ edit]Main article: Utility cooperative A utility cooperative is a type of consumers\\' cooperative that is tasked with the delivery of a public utility such as electricity, water or telecommunications services to its members. Profits are either reinvested into infrastructure or distributed to members in the form of \"patronage\" or \"capital credits\", which are essentially dividends paid on a member\\'s investment into the cooperative. In the United States, many cooperatives were formed to provide rural electrical and telephone service as part of the New Deal. See Rural Utilities Service. In the case of electricity, cooperatives are generally either generation and transmission (G&T) co-ops that create and send power via the transmission grid or local distribution co-ops that gather electricity from a variety of sources and send it along to homes and businesses. In Tanzania, it has been proven that the cooperative method is helpful in water distribution. When the people are involved with their own water, they care more because the quality of their work has a direct effect on the quality of their water. Agricultural cooperative [ edit]Grain elevators are used by agricultural cooperatives in the storage and shipping of grains. Main article: Agricultural cooperative Agricultural cooperatives or farmers\\' cooperatives are cooperatives where farmers pool their resources for mutual economic benefit. Agricultural cooperatives are broadly divided into agricultural service cooperatives, which provide various services to their individual farming members, and agricultural production cooperatives, where production resources such as land or machinery are pooled and members farm jointly. [39] Known examples of agricultural production cooperatives are the cranberry-and-grapefruit cooperative Ocean Spray, collective farms in socialist states and the kibbutzim in Israel. Agricultural supply cooperatives aggregate purchases, storage, and distribution of farm inputs for their members. By taking advantage of volume discounts and utilizing other economies of scale, supply cooperatives bring down members\\' costs. Supply cooperatives may provide seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery. Some supply cooperatives also operate machinery pools that provide mechanical field services (e.g., plowing, harvesting) to their members. Agricultural marketing cooperatives provide the services involved in moving a product from the point of production to the point of consumption. Agricultural marketing includes a series of interconnected activities involving planning production, growing and harvesting, grading, packing, transport, storage, food processing, distribution and sale. Agricultural marketing cooperatives are often formed to promote specific commodities. Commercially successful cooperatives include India\\'s Amul (dairy products), Dairy Farmers of America (dairy products) in the United States, and Malaysia\\'s FELDA ( palm oil ). Credit unions, cooperative banking and co-operative insurance [ edit]Main articles: Cooperative banking and Credit union The Co-operative Bank \\'s head office in Manchester. The statue in front is of Robert Owen, a pioneer in the cooperative movement. Credit unions are cooperative financial institutions that are owned and controlled by their members. Credit unions provide the same financial services as banks but are considered not-for-profit organizations and adhere to cooperative principles. Credit unions originated in mid-19th-century Germany through the efforts of pioneers Franz Herman Schulze\\'Delitzsch and Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen. The concept of financial cooperatives crossed the Atlantic at the turn of the 20th century, when the caisse populaire movement was started by Alphonse Desjardins in Quebec, Canada. In 1900, from his home in Lévis, he opened North America\\'s first credit union, marking the beginning of the Mouvement Desjardins. Eight years later, Desjardins provided guidance for the first credit union in the United States, where there are now about 7,950 active status federally insured credit unions, with almost 90 million members and more than $679 billion on deposit. Cooperative banking networks, which were nationalized in Eastern Europe, work now as real cooperative institutions. In Poland, the SKOK ( Spółdzielcze Kasy Oszczędnościowo-Kredytowe) network has grown to serve over 1 million members via 13,000 branches, and is larger than the country’s largest conventional bank. In Scandinavia, there is a clear distinction between mutual savings banks (Sparbank) and true credit unions (Andelsbank). The oldest cooperative banks in Europe, based on the ideas of Friedrich Raiffeisen, are joined together in the \\'Urgenossen\\'. Federal or secondary cooperatives [ edit]Main article: Cooperative Federation In some cases, cooperative societies find it advantageous to form cooperative federations in which all of the members are themselves cooperatives. Historically, these have predominantly come in the form of cooperative wholesale societies, and cooperative unions. Cooperative federations are a means through which cooperative societies can fulfill the sixth Rochdale Principle, cooperation among cooperatives, with the ICA noting that \"Cooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local, regional and international structures. \"See also: List of Co-operative Federations Cooperative wholesale society [ edit]Main article: Cooperative wholesale society According to cooperative economist Charles Gide, the aim of a cooperative wholesale society is to arrange \"bulk purchases, and, if possible, organise production.\" The best historical example of this was the English CWS and the Scottish CWS, which were the forerunners to the modern Co-operative Group. Today, its national buying programme, the Co-operative Retail Trading Group performs a similar function. Cooperative union [ edit]A second common form of cooperative federation is a cooperative union, whose objective (according to Gide) is \"to develop the spirit of solidarity among societies and... in a word, to exercise the functions of a government whose authority, it is needless to say, is purely moral.\" Co-operatives UK and the International Cooperative Alliance are examples of such arrangements. Cooperative political movements [ edit]In some countries with a strong cooperative sector, such as the UK, cooperatives may find it advantageous to form political groupings to represent their interests. The British Co-operative Party, the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and United Farmers of Alberta are prime examples of such arrangements. UK [ edit]The British cooperative movement formed the Co-operative Party in the early 20th century to represent members of consumers\\' cooperatives in Parliament, which was the first of its kind. The Co-operative Party now has a permanent electoral pact with the Labour Party meaning someone cannot be a member if they support a party other than Labour. Plaid Cymru also run a credit union that is constituted as a co-operative, called the \\'Plaid Cymru Credit Union\\'. [40] UK cooperatives retain a strong market share in food retail, insurance, banking, funeral services, and the travel industry in many parts of the country, although this is still significantly lower than other business models. [41]Philippines [ edit]The Cooperative NATCCO Party ( Coop-NATCCO) is a party-list in the Philippines which serves as the electoral wing of the National Confederation of Cooperatives (NATCCO). Coop-NATCCO has represented the Philippine co-operative sector in the Philippine 11th Congress since 1998. Women in cooperatives [ edit]Main article: Women in cooperatives Since cooperatives are based on values like self-help, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity, they can play a particularly strong role in empowering women, especially in developing countries. [42] Cooperatives allow women who might have been isolated and working individually to band together and create economies of scale as well as increase their own bargaining power in the market. In statements in advance of International Women\\'s Day in early 2013, President of the International Cooperative Alliance, Dame Pauline Green, said, \"Cooperative businesses have done so much to help women onto the ladder of economic activity. With that comes community respect, political legitimacy and influence. \"However, despite the supposed democratic structure of cooperatives and the values and benefits shared by members, due to gender norms on the traditional role of women, and other instilled cultural practices that sidestep attempted legal protections, women suffer a disproportionately low representation in cooperative membership around the world. Representation of women through active membership (showing up to meetings and voting), as well as in leadership and managerial positions is even lower. [43]Cooperatives in popular culture [ edit]As of 2012, the number of memberships in cooperatives reached one billion, [44] and so the organizational structure and movement has seeped into popular culture. In the HBO drama television series The Wire, several drug dealers create a democratic alliance called the New Day Co-Op with the interests of cutting back on violence and increasing business. Co-opoly: The Game of Cooperatives is a popular board game played around the world that challenges players to work together to start and run a cooperative and overcome major hurdles. [45] [46]My So-Called Housing Cooperative is a web series focusing on the humorous side of living in a housing co-op.

There are several interpretations of Spring. Astronomically, it begins on the Vernal Equinox, which is on or around March 21st, and ends on the Summer Solstice, on or about June 21st. Then there is Meteorological Spring, which begins on March 1st and ends on May 31st. Finally, there is observable Spring, which is when the leaves bud, plants that were dormant over the winter begin to grow and animals that hibernate wake up. That, obviously, differs from place to place, both in when it starts and how long it lasts. Where I live, in coastal Florida, we have no observable Spring in that sense.14.3k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by Jack Franklinpromoted by Truth Finder Have you ever googled yourself?

With set dates. The major cultural holidays and holydays occur then. Gardeners will probably notice there's definitely one day that signals a change in plant behavior. Before I learned how to garden in a semi-tropical climate (northern CA), it was all very confusing. At the very least, our weather in spring matches summer elsewhere in most of the US. Plants bloom in different seasons here than any US garden book will tell you. And yet, on Mar 20, Jun 21, etc. something changes. It might not follow the formula in the manual, but something changes. Completely unrelated to weather. Though the weather determines what changes specifically, the fact that something changes on that specific day was weird. For example, on Jun 21, there is no bloom in a CA garden. The garden shops are full of plants in bloom that day. That led me to the answer. Plants in the CA garden shops for the most part are brought to bloom in the “conventional” season by altering light. Research on the topic indicated that the number of hours of darkness was the key contributing factor to the change. On that day, everywhere, the number of daylight versus darkness hours changes. Regardless of the weather. That is the signal that the plants are responding to.6/17 edit Can't resist: A Breathing Earth3.1k Views · View Upvoterspromoted by Jet Brains Level up your code with Intelli J IDEA.

Also, weather in certain areas can be very changeable— it may seem like spring has come, when suddenly, the weather turns cold again. If you are asking this question because you want to plan a visit, be sure to check online with the weather service from that particular state or region; also useful is checking newspapers from the particular place you plan to go.

Abroad [ edit]Drivers from around the world have set their sights on Formula Drift as the series of choice worldwide in which to compete. This also includes the legions of talented drivers from Japan, who have competed previously in the D1 Grand Prix. Other drivers who crossed over to Formula Drift from foreign series are the Irish drivers Darren Mc Namara, James Deane, Eric O\\'Sullivan, and Dean Kearney. These drivers rose to acclaim in their European home series before making the move stateside. Tracks [ edit]Current tracks [ edit]Rd. 1 Long Beach GP street course, Long Beach, CA.

Our priority is to continue to build the Series here while growing the sport of drifting as a whole,\" said Jim Liaw, president and co-founder of Formula Drift. \"We are very careful in choosing our event partners and take careful consideration of the boundaries of our international affiliates such as Drift Australia, MSC, and Pro Drift.\" [1]Sister series [ edit]Formula Drift Asia. Formula Drift Asia was created in 2008 with the inaugural FD Singapore competition. The first real international competition of its in Asia, held at the Changi Air Show Grounds. This historic event was sold out before the gates opened. Since then, Formula Drift Asia became its own championship series, the first Pan-Asian professional drifting championship. In 2009 and 2010, the Championship made stops in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. For the 2011/2012 Championship tour, Formula Drift Asia added an additional stop in Indonesia. FD Asia web site.

Car eligibility [ edit]Cars and their builds are constantly under review by the Formula Drift staff. The rule book is revised every year to promote fair and exciting drifting. Some cars and practices are written out of the rule book in order to keep a realistic and level playing field. During the 2004 season, the Dodge Viper Competition Coupe was permitted to compete; subsequently it was ineligible in Formula Drift. Although Formula Drift does not permit front-wheel drive cars, it does allow all-wheel drive cars to be converted to rear wheel drive, such as the Subaru WRX and Mitsubishi EVO. In the United States, the Scion t C is sold only in the FWD layout, but because it shares the same chassis as the AWD Toyota Avensis (sold only in the United Kingdom and Europe), it can be converted to a competition-ready RWD layout. This change sparked great debate between drifters in the series who felt that an original FWD vehicle should not be eligible due to the front cross member changes needed. A trademark of Formula D competition car\\'s is the very open engine rulebook. Formula Drift allows engines from other manufacturers to be swapped into competition cars. \"Engine, transmission, ECU and/or final drive modifications are free, but only the rear wheels may propel the vehicle\". This results in a huge variety of engine/chassis combinations as well as huge power outputs commonly in excess of 850+ whp. Vehicles wishing to compete for the Manufacturers Championship must use an engine from the same manufacturer as the chassis. Engine swaps remain very common with older models but can be seen with new builds as well. Normally aspirated Chevrolet V8 engines are often used because of their availability and lower operating costs. Suspension modification is widely open to development as long as stock pickup locations are utilized. Suspension tuning is a vital part of any successful Formula D team. To keep cars in check Formula D institutes a maximum tire size based on the vehicles total weight. Formula Drift cars are given fixed numbers for their cars and are not necessarily based on rankings. Scoring and judging [ edit]Formula D uses its own scoring system that may differ from other drifting organizations. Often scoring systems for qualifying, tandem battles, and penalties are different. Qualifying – Formula D competitors are allowed two non-consecutive judged solo runs to post their highest possible score in order to compete. The top 32 drivers with the highest qualifying scores are entered in a competition bracket pairing the highest scoring drivers against the lowest scoring drivers. 1st v. 32nd, 2nd v. 31st, 3rd v. 30th, etc. The drivers are judged on line, speed, angle, and overall impact. The judges can also make additional request at the drivers meeting for actions or techniques that will weigh in their decision making (ex; entry technique, racing line, proximity, etc.). Formula D drivers are scored on a points-deduction system where every driver will start their judged run with a perfect score of 100 pts. For every mistake, points will be deducted. These points will vary between .25 point to the most severe mistakes (-1.75). [2]Competition – The top 32 qualifying drivers are paired up in an elimination bracket pairing the highest scoring drivers against the lowest scoring drivers. The biggest difference from qualifying is that now drivers face off head to head on the track in a tandem battle. The two cars run together side by side, each driver trying to show greater skill than the other. The highest qualifying driver leads on the first run, then on the second run the lower qualifying driver leads. Drivers are judged on the same basic criteria as qualifying but an emphasis is put on the interaction between the two drivers competing head to head. The lead driver will set the pace and driving line often trying to produce a gap between themselves and the following driver. The following driver will try to stay on top of the lead driver as close as possible without making contact with their vehicle. The goal is to mimic or \"shadow\" the lead drivers run while staying on their door throughout the run. It is possible for either driver to win either run. Often one driver will have a points advantage going into the second run. Driver mistakes (ex. 2 wheels off course, spinning out, avoidable contact, etc.) can also cause them to be given an automatic zero. The three-judge panel then will look at both runs and determine one of three outcomes; Driver 1 advances, Driver 2 advances, or if a winner can not be determined a \"One More Time\" will be called. In the event of a \"One More Time\" the drivers will then complete a new pair of runs. The drivers will face off again until a winner can be determined. The winner advance to the next bracket. Competition Time Out – Drivers have a one-time option to utilize a \"Competition Time Out\" in order to attempt to fix their vehicle. In the event that a driver or car can not come to the start line in time for their tandem run the other driver will be allowed to run a solo lap to advance. Overtaking – Formula D rules are structured so as not to encourage drivers to overtake their opponents; doing so incurs a penalty. Overtaking is only permitted when the lead car makes a mistake such as coming to a complete stop or going completely off course. [2]The current judges are Andy Yen, Ryan Lanteigne, and Brian Eggert. Doug Artus is the Race Manager for the series. [2]Formula Drift Champions [ edit]This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources.

Rossi Morreale was the show\\'s host in 2005. Johnson was joined by Attack of the Show co-host Olivia Munn who covered the pits and drivers during the events and drifting expert Adam Matthews who provided commentary and insight on the tandem battles. G4 aired each round on a tape-delayed basis. Jarod De Anda is the public address announcer at each event, earning him the moniker, \"The Voice of Formula D.\" In 2005, G4 used De Anda\\'s event commentary track, but for 2006, used Johnson and Matthews calling each battle like a typical play-by-play / color commentator combination. Johnson and Matthews were on-site for each event, but it sounded as if they had taped their commentary after the event had already taken place. This practice is not uncommon in the motorsports business in post-production. In the 2005 season, there were two people working the pits — driver interviewer Mayleen Ramey, who was a roving reporter for the half-hour episodes, and a second anchor, who patrolled around the car show at each event. In 2005, G4 used three reporters for this job. From the round in Wall to the round in Houston, actor Emeka Nnadi held the job. At the Infineon round, Attack of the Show! co-host Kevin Pereira took the duties, while Street Fury host Big C finished things out in Chicago and Irwindale. Also, G4 showed half-hour episodes in-between rounds, most of which focused on the network having its own drift car built from scratch, with other segments focusing on the aspects of drifting. One of the first half-hour episodes in 2005 had one Formula D competitor, Chris Forsberg go to Japan, and meet up with another competitor, Daijiro Yoshihara, to explore the country and get more perspective on the birth of drifting. Episodes that featured event coverage lasted an hour-and-a-half, and featured the top 16 tandem rounds, including those that needed to be run again, because the judges deemed them too close to call. These episodes aired the night after the next round in the series had already taken place. In 2006, however, coverage was dramatically different. The half-hour episodes were gone, and event coverage was reduced to an hour, and their scheduling was quite random. The Long Beach and Atlanta rounds premiered on June 18, with the Chicago round airing on July 2, and the Sonoma round airing a week after it took place. During the Sonoma round, G4 noted that the Seattle round would premiere on September 10, but that date was changed to October 8, with the last two rounds (Wall and Irwindale) airing every other week afterward. These episodes featured more interviews and driver profiles, many of which would\\'ve been placed in a half-hour show last year, and many of the tandem battles have been cut out, and any battle that needed to be run again did not have its second run shown. This led to some criticism from those in the drifting community, including fans and some Formula D drivers. At the 2006 SEMA Show in Las Vegas, Formula D co-founders Jim Liaw and Ryan Sage announced that the series would have a new television partner in 2007. That partner was ESPN2. Each round began airing in a one-hour block on November 15 with the Long Beach round. All subsequent airings were supposed to be every Thursday afterward, but beginning with the Evergreen Speedway round on December 5, the air dates for new rounds switched to Wednesday. The ESPN deal lasted just one season. SPEED Channel will air all rounds of the 2008 Formula D season, as well as the World Championship, scheduled for after the Irwindale round. Airings will take place on Sundays, beginning with the Long Beach round on October 26. All airings will begin at 4 PM Eastern. [10]For 2010 Formula Drift announces a comprehensive race programming schedule with VERSUS in which Drifting, the fastest-growing motorsport, will slide into more than 75 million U. S. homes. The seven-stop Formula DRIFT Championship Series programs will air over fourteen Sundays during the 2 PM (EST) / 11 AM (PST) time slot beginning Sunday, August 30. Each episode will showcase all the on- and off-track action as the world’s top drift drivers battle for the coveted title of Formula DRIFT Champion. The first episode, airing on August 30, will feature a comprehensive overview of the sport and drivers. Each episode will re-air the week following the initial airing. [11] Coverage is slated to remain the same for the 2011 season. In 2012 NBC\\'s merger with Comcast, Comcast\\'s sports channels were combined under the NBC Sports division, in an arrangement known as the NBC Sports Group, which also comprises Golf Channel, the Comcast Sports Net regional sports networks, and Versus, which was re-launched as the NBC Sports Network on January 2, 2012. Internet Coverage [ edit]In 2010 Formula D joined forces with Justin.tv to bring a live stream of all 7 events. All rounds were broadcast via Justin.tv complete with practices and all rounds of competition were included. During the 2010 season over 1,000,000 viewers tuned in to watch the live action unfold over the 7 Pro Championship events.2013 Formula D partnered with Livestream for the domestic series.2014 Formula D partnered with Daily Motion for its live stream. Formula D now broadcasts online at Formula Drift Live and on Motor Trend On Demand. Print Coverage [ edit]At the 2010 SEMA show, FD co-founder Jim Liaw announced the Formula Drift would begin the quarterly publication of a Formula Drift\\'s magazine in 2011. The publication will be handled by Haymarket Media Group. References [ edit]Book: Drifting^ \"Formula DRIFT - 404\".^ a b c \"Judging Information\".

Historically, it was mostly used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances. The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge (s) to the soundboard. Contents [ hide ]1 Name2 History and use2.1 Modern music3 Structure and action4 Fretting5 Pedal clavichord6 Repertoire7 References8 External links Name [ edit]The name is derived from the Latin word clavis, meaning \"key\" (associated with more common clavus, meaning \"nail, rod, etc.\") and chorda (from Greek χορδή) meaning \"string, especially of a musical instrument\". An analogous name is used in other European languages (It. clavicordio, clavicordo; Fr. clavicorde; Germ. Klavichord; Lat. clavicordium; Port. clavicórdio; Sp. clavicordio ). Many languages also have another name derived from Latin manus, meaning \"hand\" (It. manicordo; Fr. manicorde, manicordion; Sp. manicordio, manucordio ). Other names refer to the monochord -like nature of a fully fretted clavichord (It. monacordo or monocordo; Sp. monacordio ). Italian also used sordino, a reference to its quiet sound ( sordino usually designates a mute). [1]History and use [ edit]The clavichord was invented in the early fourteenth century. [2] [3] In 1504, the German poem \" Der Minne Regeln \" mentions the terms clavicimbalum (a term used mainly for the harpsichord) and clavichordium, designating them as the best instruments to accompany melodies. The \"Lépante\" fretted clavichord, [4] Musée de la Musique, Paris One of the earliest references to the clavichord in England occurs in the privy-purse expenses of Elizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII, in an entry dated August 1502: Item. The same day, Hugh Denys for money by him delivered to a stranger that gave the queen a payre of clavycordes. In crowns form his reward iiii libres. [5]The clavichord was very popular from the 16th century to the 18th century, but mainly flourished in German-speaking lands, Scandinavia, and the Iberian Peninsula in the latter part of this period. It had fallen out of use by 1850. In the late 1890s, Arnold Dolmetsch revived clavichord construction and Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, among others, helped to popularize the instrument. Although most of the instruments built before the 1730s were small (four octaves, four feet long), the latest instruments were built up to seven feet long with a six octave range. [ citation needed]Today clavichords are played primarily by Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical music enthusiasts. They attract many interested buyers, and are manufactured worldwide. There are now numerous clavichord societies around the world, and some 400 recordings of the instrument have been made in the past 70 years. Leading modern exponents of the instrument have included Christopher Hogwood and Thurston Dart. Modern music [ edit]The clavichord has also gained attention in other genres of music, in the form of the Clavinet, which is essentially an electric clavichord that uses a magnetic pickup to produce a signal for amplification. Stevie Wonder uses a Clavinet in many of his songs, such as \" Superstition \" and \" Higher Ground \". A Clavinet played through an instrument amplifier with guitar effect pedals is often associated with funky, disco -infused 1970s rock. Guy Sigsworth has played clavichord in a modern setting with Björk, notably on the studio recording of \" All Is Full of Love \". Björk also made extensive use of and even played the instrument herself on the song \"My Juvenile\" of her 2007 album Volta. Tori Amos uses the instrument on \"Little Amsterdam\" from the album Boys for Pele and on the song \"Smokey Joe\" from her 2007 album American Doll Posse. Amos also featured her use of the Clavinet on her 2004 recording \"Not David Bowie\", released as part of her 2006 box set, A Piano: The Collection. In 1976 Oscar Peterson played (with Joe Pass on acoustic guitar) songs from Porgy And Bess on the clavichord. Keith Jarrett also recorded an album entitled Book of Ways (1987) in which he plays a series of clavichord improvisations. The Beatles \\' \" For No One \" (1966) features Paul Mc Cartney playing the clavichord. Rick Wakeman plays the Clavinet in the track \"The Battle\" from the album Journey to the Centre of the Earth. Structure and action [ edit]Schematic diagram of clavichord mechanism: A/B. Keys. 1A/1B. Tangents. 2A/2B. Keylevers. 3. String. 4. Soundboard. 5. Bridge-pin, next to hitch-pin. 6. Damping felt, next to tuning peg. (Note that this sketch is a simplification. In the actual instrument, the strings run perpendicular to the keylevers. In other words, the strings run lengthwise in the instrument.) [6]Detail of the Clavichord at Museu de la Música de Barcelona In the clavichord, strings run transversely from the hitchpin rail at the left-hand end to tuning pegs on the right. Towards the right end they pass over a curved wooden bridge. The action is simple, with the keys being levers with a small brass tangent, a small piece of metal similar in shape and size to the head of a flat-bladed screwdriver, at the far end. The strings, which are usually of brass, or else a combination of brass and iron, are usually arranged in pairs, like a lute or mandolin. When the key is pressed, the tangent strikes the strings above, causing them to sound in a similar fashion to the hammering technique on a guitar. Unlike in a piano action, the tangent does not rebound from the string; rather, it stays in contact with the string as long as the key is held, acting as both the nut and as the initiator of sound. The volume of the note can be changed by striking harder or softer, and the pitch can also be affected by varying the force of the tangent against the string (known as Bebung ). When the key is released, the tangent loses contact with the string and the vibration of the string is silenced by strips of damping cloth. The action of the clavichord is unique among all keyboard instruments in that one part of the action simultaneously initiates the sound vibration while at the same time defining the endpoint of the vibrating string, and thus its pitch. Because of this intimate contact between the player\\'s hand and the production of sound, the clavichord has been referred to as the most intimate of keyboard instruments. Despite its many (serious) limitations, including extremely low volume, it has considerable expressive power, the player being able to control attack, duration, volume, and even provide certain subtle effects of swelling of tone and a type of vibrato unique to the clavichord. Fretting [ edit]Large five-octave unfretted clavichord by Paul Maurici, after J. A. Hass Fretted clavichord, copy of an unsigned instrument conserved in Namur, Belgium. The way the same string pair is used for several notes is clearly visible in the full size image. Since the string vibrates from the bridge only as far as the tangent, multiple keys with multiple tangents can be assigned to the same string. This is called fretting. Early clavichords frequently had many notes played on each string, even going so far as the keyed monochord — an instrument with only one string—though most clavichords were triple- or double-fretted. Since only one note can be played at a time on each string, the fretting pattern is generally chosen so that notes rarely heard together (such as C and C ♯) share a string pair. The advantages of this system compared with unfretted instruments (see below) include relative ease of tuning (with around half as many strings to keep in tune), greater volume (though still not really enough for use in chamber music ), and a clearer, more direct sound. Among the disadvantages: temperament could not be re-set without bending the tangents; and playing required a further refinement of touch, since notes sharing a single string played in quick succession had to be slightly separated to avoid a disagreeable deadening of the sound, potentially disturbing a legato line. Some clavichords have been built with a single pair of strings for each note. The first known reference to one was by Johann Speth in 1693 and the earliest such extant signed and dated clavichord was built in 1716 by Johann Michael Heinitz. Such instruments are referred to as unfretted whereas instruments using the same strings for several notes are called fretted. Among the advantages to unfretted instruments are flexibility in tuning (the temperament can be easily altered) and the ability to play any music exactly as written without concern for \"bad\" notes. Disadvantages include a smaller volume, even though many or most unfretted instruments tend to be significantly larger than fretted instruments; and many more strings to keep in tune. Unfretted instruments tend to have a sweeter, less incisive tone due to the greater load on the bridge resulting from the greater number of strings, though the large, late (early 19th century) Swedish clavichords tend to be the loudest of any of the historic clavichords. Pedal clavichord [ edit]J. Verscheure Reynvaan: engraving of an eighteenth-century pedal clavichord Main article: Pedal clavichord While clavichords were typically single manual instruments, they could be stacked, one clavichord on top of another, to provide multiple keyboards. With the addition of a pedal clavichord, which included a pedal keyboard for the lower notes, a clavichord could be used to practice organ repertoire. Most often, the addition of a pedal keyboard only involved connecting the keys of the pedalboard to the lower notes on the manual clavichord using string so the lower notes on the manual instrument could be operated by the feet. In the era of pipe organs, which used man-powered bellows that required several people to operate, and of churches only heated during church services if at all, organists used pedal harpsichords and pedal clavichords as practice instruments (see also: pedal piano ). [7] There is speculation that some works written for organ may have been intended for pedal clavichord. An interesting case is made by Speerstra (2004) that Bach\\'s \"Eight Little Preludes and Fugues\", now thought spurious, may actually be authentic. The keyboard writing seems unsuited to organ, but Speerstra argues that they are idiomatic on the pedal clavichord. As Speerstra and Williams (2003) also note, the compass of the keyboard parts of Bach\\'s six trio sonatas for organ (BWV 525–530) rarely go below the tenor C, so they could have been played on a single manual pedal clavichord, by moving the left hand down an octave, a customary practice in the 18th century. Repertoire [ edit]Much of the musical repertoire written for harpsichord and organ from the period circa 1400–1800 can be played on the clavichord; however, it does not have enough (unamplified) volume to participate in chamber music, with the possible exception of providing accompaniment to a soft baroque flute, recorder, or single singer. J. S. Bach\\'s son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was a great proponent of the instrument, and most of his German contemporaries regarded it as a central keyboard instrument, for performing, teaching, composing and practicing. The fretting of a clavichord provides new problems for some repertoire, but scholarship suggests that these problems are not insurmountable in Bach\\'s Well-Tempered Clavier ( Loucks (1992) ). Among recent clavichord recordings, those by Christopher Hogwood ( The Secret Bach, The Secret Handel, and The Secret Mozart ), break new ground. In his liner notes, Hogwood pointed out that these composers would typically have played the clavichord in the privacy of their homes. In England, the composer Herbert Howells (1892–1983) wrote two significant collections of pieces for clavichord ( Lambert \\'s Clavichord and Howells\\' Clavichord ), and Stephen Dodgson (1924–2013) wrote two clavichord suites.

It allows audio and video communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need to install plugins or download native apps. [1] Supported by Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Opera, Web RTC is being standardized through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). [2]Its mission is to \"enable rich, high-quality RTC applications to be developed for the browser, mobile platforms, and Io T devices, and allow them all to communicate via a common set of protocols \". [2] The reference implementation is released as free software under the terms of a BSD license. Open Web RTC provides another free implementation based on the multimedia framework GStreamer. Java Script inventor Brendan Eich called it a \"new front in the long war for an open and unencumbered web\". [3]Contents [ hide ]1 History2 Overview2.1 Design2.2 Examples2.3 Support3 Concerns4 See also5 References6 Further reading7 External links History [ edit]In May 2010, Google bought Global IP Solutions or GIPS, a Vo IP and videoconferencing software company that had developed many components required for RTC, such as codecs and echo cancellation techniques. Google open-sourced the GIPS technology and engaged with relevant standards bodies at the IETF and W3C to ensure industry consensus. [4] [5] In May 2011, Google released an open-source project for browser-based real-time communication known as Web RTC. [6] This has been followed by ongoing work to standardize the relevant protocols in the IETF [7] and browser APIs in the W3C. [8]In May 2011, Ericsson Labs built the first implementation of Web RTC using a modified Web Kit library. [9] In October 2011, the W3C published its first draft for the spec. [10] Web RTC milestones include the first cross-browser video call (February 2013), first cross-browser data transfers (February 2014), and as of July 2014 Google Hangouts was \"kind of\" using Web RTC. [11]The W3C draft of Web RTC [12] is a work in progress with advanced implementations in the Chrome and Firefox browsers. The API is based on preliminary work done in the WHATWG. [13] It was referred to as the Connection Peer API, and a pre-standards concept implementation was created at Ericsson Labs. [14] The Web RTC Working Group expects this specification to evolve significantly based on: Outcomes of ongoing exchanges in the companion RTCWEB group at IETF [15] to define the set of protocols that, together with this document, define real-time communications in web browsers. While no one signaling protocol is mandated, SIP over Websockets ( RFC 7118) is often used partially due to the applicability of SIP to most of the envisaged communication scenarios as well as the availability of open-source software such as Js SIP. Privacy issues that arise when exposing local capabilities and local streams Technical discussions within the group, on implementing data channels in particular [16]Experience gained through early experimentation Feedback from other groups and individuals Overview [ edit]Design [ edit]Major components of Web RTC include several Java Script APIs:get User Media acquires the audio and video media (e.g., by accessing a device\\'s camera and microphone). [17]RTCPeer Connection enables audio and video communication between peers. It performs signal processing, codec handling, peer-to-peer communication, security, and bandwidth management. [18]RTCData Channel allows bidirectional communication of arbitrary data between peers. It uses the same API as Web Sockets and has very low latency. [19]The Web RTC API also includes a statistics function:get Stats allows the web application to retrieve a set of statistics about Web RTC sessions. These statistics data are being described in a separate W3C document. [20]RFC 7874 requires implementations to provide PCMA / PCMU ( RFC 3551 ), Telephone Event as DTMF ( RFC 4733 ), and Opus ( RFC 6716) audio codecs as minimum capabilities. The Peer Connection, data channel and media capture browser APIs are detailed in the W3C. W3C is developing ORTC (Object Real-Time Communications) for Web RTC. [21] This is commonly referred to as Web RTC 1.1. Examples [ edit]Although initially developed for web browsers, Web RTC has applications for non-browser devices, including mobile platforms and Io T devices. Examples include browser-based Vo IP telephony, also called cloud phones or web phones, which allow calls to be made and received from within a web browser, replacing the requirement to download and install a softphone. [22]Support [ edit]Web RTC is supported by the following browsers: Desktop PCMicrosoft Edge 12 [23]Google Chrome 28Mozilla Firefox 22 [24]Safari 11 [25]Opera 18 [26]Vivaldi 1.9Android Google Chrome 28 (enabled by default since 29)Mozilla Firefox 24 [27]Opera Mobile 12Chrome OSFirefox OSBlackberry 10i OS 11Mobile Safari/Web Kit Tizen 3.0Support was not included in Internet Explorer prior to its final feature release in October 2013 [28], but 3rd party plugins are available to add the support of Web RTC to IE and Safari for Mac OS. [29] [30] At WWDC 2017, Apple announced Safari would get Web RTC support in Safari 11, [25] and it was made available in release 32 of the Safari Technology Preview. [31]Concerns [ edit]Main article: DNS leak In January 2015, Torrent Freak reported a serious security flaw in browsers that support Web RTC, saying that it compromised the security of VPN tunnels, by exposing the true IP address of a user. [32] The IP address read requests are not visible in the browser\\'s developer console, and they are not blocked by most ad blocking / privacy / security add-ons, enabling online tracking by advertisers and other entities despite precautions [33] (however the u Block Origin add-on can fix this problem).

Motherboard for an Acer desktop personal computer, showing the typical components and interfaces that are found on a motherboard. This model was made by Foxconn in 2007, and follows the micro ATX layout (known as the \" form factor \") usually employed for desktop computers. It is designed to work with AMD\\'s Athlon 64 processor Intel D945GCPE: A micro ATX Motherboard LGA775 for Intel Pentium 4, D, XE, Dual-Core, Core 2 (circa 2007)A motherboard (sometimes alternatively known as the mainboard, system board, baseboard, planar board or logic board, [1] or colloquially, a mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in general purpose microcomputers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems such as the central processor, the chipset\\'s input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general purpose use. Motherboard specifically refers to a PCB with expansion capability and as the name suggests, this board is often referred to as the \"mother\" of all components attached to it, which often include peripherals, interface cards, and daughtercards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, hard drives, or other forms of persistent storage; TV tuner cards, cards providing extra USB or Fire Wire slots and a variety of other custom components. Similarly, the term mainboard is applied to devices with a single board and no additional expansions or capability, such as controlling boards in laser printers, televisions, washing machines and other embedded systems with limited expansion abilities.

In very old designs, copper wires were the discrete connections between card connector pins, but printed circuit boards soon became the standard practice. The Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and peripherals were housed on individual printed circuit boards, which were plugged into the backplane. The ubiquitous S-100 bus of the 1970s is an example of this type of backplane system. The most popular computers of the 1980s such as the Apple II and IBM PC had published schematic diagrams and other documentation which permitted rapid reverse-engineering and third-party replacement motherboards. Usually intended for building new computers compatible with the exemplars, many motherboards offered additional performance or other features and were used to upgrade the manufacturer\\'s original equipment. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, it became economical to move an increasing number of peripheral functions onto the motherboard. In the late 1980s, personal computer motherboards began to include single ICs (also called Super I/O chips) capable of supporting a set of low-speed peripherals: keyboard, mouse, floppy disk drive, serial ports, and parallel ports. By the late 1990s, many personal computer motherboards included consumer grade embedded audio, video, storage, and networking functions without the need for any expansion cards at all; higher-end systems for 3D gaming and computer graphics typically retained only the graphics card as a separate component. Business PCs, workstations, and servers were more likely to need expansion cards, either for more robust functions, or for higher speeds; those systems often had fewer embedded components. Laptop and notebook computers that were developed in the 1990s integrated the most common peripherals. This even included motherboards with no upgradeable components, a trend that would continue as smaller systems were introduced after the turn of the century (like the tablet computer and the netbook ). Memory, processors, network controllers, power source, and storage would be integrated into some systems. Design [ edit]The Octek Jaguar V motherboard from 1993. [2] This board has few onboard peripherals, as evidenced by the 6 slots provided for ISA cards and the lack of other built-in external interface connectors. Note the large AT keyboard connector at the back right is its only peripheral interface. The motherboard of a Samsung Galaxy SII; almost all functions of the device are integrated into a very small board A motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the other components of the system communicate. Unlike a backplane, it also contains the central processing unit and hosts other subsystems and devices. A typical desktop computer has its microprocessor, main memory, and other essential components connected to the motherboard. Other components such as external storage, controllers for video display and sound, and peripheral devices may be attached to the motherboard as plug-in cards or via cables; in modern microcomputers it is increasingly common to integrate some of these peripherals into the motherboard itself. An important component of a motherboard is the microprocessor\\'s supporting chipset, which provides the supporting interfaces between the CPU and the various buses and external components. This chipset determines, to an extent, the features and capabilities of the motherboard. Modern motherboards include: Sockets (or slots) in which one or more microprocessors may be installed. In the case of CPUs in ball grid array packages, such as the VIA C3, the CPU is directly soldered to the motherboard. [3]Slots into which the system\\'s main memory is to be installed (typically in the form of DIMM modules containing DRAM chips)A chipset which forms an interface between the CPU\\'s front-side bus, main memory, and peripheral buses Non-volatile memory chips (usually Flash ROM in modern motherboards) containing the system\\'s firmware or BIOSA clock generator which produces the system clock signal to synchronize the various components Slots for expansion cards (the interface to the system via the buses supported by the chipset)Power connectors, which receive electrical power from the computer power supply and distribute it to the CPU, chipset, main memory, and expansion cards. As of 2007, some graphics cards (e.g. Ge Force 8 and Radeon R600) require more power than the motherboard can provide, and thus dedicated connectors have been introduced to attach them directly to the power supply. [4]Connectors for hard drives, typically SATA only. Disk drives also connect to the power supply. Additionally, nearly all motherboards include logic and connectors to support commonly used input devices, such as USB for mouse devices and keyboards. Early personal computers such as the Apple II or IBM PC included only this minimal peripheral support on the motherboard. Occasionally video interface hardware was also integrated into the motherboard; for example, on the Apple II and rarely on IBM-compatible computers such as the IBM PC Jr. Additional peripherals such as disk controllers and serial ports were provided as expansion cards. Given the high thermal design power of high-speed computer CPUs and components, modern motherboards nearly always include heat sinks and mounting points for fans to dissipate excess heat. Form factor [ edit]Main article: Comparison of computer form factors Motherboards are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes called computer form factor, some of which are specific to individual computer manufacturers. However, the motherboards used in IBM-compatible systems are designed to fit various case sizes. As of 2007, most desktop computer motherboards use the ATX standard form factor — even those found in Macintosh and Sun computers, which have not been built from commodity components. A case\\'s motherboard and PSU form factor must all match, though some smaller form factor motherboards of the same family will fit larger cases. For example, an ATX case will usually accommodate a micro ATX motherboard. Laptop computers generally use highly integrated, miniaturized and customized motherboards. This is one of the reasons that laptop computers are difficult to upgrade and expensive to repair. Often the failure of one laptop component requires the replacement of the entire motherboard, which is usually more expensive than a desktop motherboard due to the large number of integrated components and their custom shape and size. CPU sockets [ edit]A CPU socket (central processing unit) or slot is an electrical component that attaches to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and is designed to house a CPU (also called a microprocessor). It is a special type of integrated circuit socket designed for very high pin counts. A CPU socket provides many functions, including a physical structure to support the CPU, support for a heat sink, facilitating replacement (as well as reducing cost), and most importantly, forming an electrical interface both with the CPU and the PCB. CPU sockets on the motherboard can most often be found in most desktop and server computers (laptops typically use surface mount CPUs), particularly those based on the Intel x86 architecture. A CPU socket type and motherboard chipset must support the CPU series and speed. Integrated peripherals [ edit]Block diagram of a modern motherboard, which supports many on-board peripheral functions as well as several expansion slots With the steadily declining costs and size of integrated circuits, it is now possible to include support for many peripherals on the motherboard. By combining many functions on one PCB, the physical size and total cost of the system may be reduced; highly integrated motherboards are thus especially popular in small form factor and budget computers. Disk controllers for a floppy disk drive, up to 2 PATA drives, and up to 6 SATA drives (including RAID 0/1 support)integrated graphics controller supporting 2D and 3D graphics, with VGA and TV outputintegrated sound card supporting 8-channel (7.1) audio and S/PDIF output Fast Ethernet network controller for 10/100 Mbit networking USB 2.0 controller supporting up to 12 USB ports Ir DA controller for infrared data communication (e.g. with an Ir DA-enabled cellular phone or printer)Temperature, voltage, and fan-speed sensors that allow software to monitor the health of computer components. Peripheral card slots [ edit]A typical motherboard will have a different number of connections depending on its standard and form factor. A standard, modern ATX motherboard will typically have two or three PCI-Express 16x connection for a graphics card, one or two legacy PCI slots for various expansion cards, and one or two PCI-E 1x (which has superseded PCI ). A standard EATX motherboard will have two to four PCI-E 16x connection for graphics cards, and a varying number of PCI and PCI-E 1x slots. It can sometimes also have a PCI-E 4x slot (will vary between brands and models). Some motherboards have two or more PCI-E 16x slots, to allow more than 2 monitors without special hardware, or use a special graphics technology called SLI (for Nvidia) and Crossfire (for AMD ). These allow 2 to 4 graphics cards to be linked together, to allow better performance in intensive graphical computing tasks, such as gaming, video editing, etc. Temperature and reliability [ edit]A motherboard of a Vaio E series laptop (right)A micro ATX motherboard with some faulty capacitors Main article: Computer cooling Motherboards are generally air cooled with heat sinks often mounted on larger chips, such as the Northbridge, in modern motherboards. [5] Insufficient or improper cooling can cause damage to the internal components of the computer, or cause it to crash. Passive cooling, or a single fan mounted on the power supply, was sufficient for many desktop computer CPU\\'s until the late 1990s; since then, most have required CPU fans mounted on their heat sinks, due to rising clock speeds and power consumption. Most motherboards have connectors for additional case fans and integrated temperature sensors to detect motherboard and CPU temperatures and controllable fan connectors which the BIOS or operating system can use to regulate fan speed. [6] Alternatively computers can use a water cooling system instead of many fans. Some small form factor computers and home theater PCs designed for quiet and energy-efficient operation boast fan-less designs. This typically requires the use of a low-power CPU, as well as careful layout of the motherboard and other components to allow for heat sink placement. A 2003 study found that some spurious computer crashes and general reliability issues, ranging from screen image distortions to I/O read/write errors, can be attributed not to software or peripheral hardware but to aging capacitors on PC motherboards. [7] Ultimately this was shown to be the result of a faulty electrolyte formulation, [8] an issue termed capacitor plague. Standard motherboards use electrolytic capacitors to filter the DC power distributed around the board. These capacitors age at a temperature-dependent rate, as their water based electrolytes slowly evaporate. This can lead to loss of capacitance and subsequent motherboard malfunctions due to voltage instabilities. While most capacitors are rated for 2000 hours of operation at 105 °C (221 °F), [9] their expected design life roughly doubles for every 10 °C (18 °F) below this. At 65 °C (149 °F) a lifetime of 3 to 4 years can be expected. However, many manufacturers deliver substandard capacitors, [10] which significantly reduce life expectancy. Inadequate case cooling and elevated temperatures around the CPU socket exacerbate this problem. With top blowers, the motherboard components can be kept under 95 °C (203 °F), effectively doubling the motherboard lifetime. Mid-range and high-end motherboards on the other hand use solid capacitors exclusively. For every 10 °C less, their average lifespan is multiplied approximately by three, resulting in a 6-times higher lifetime expectancy at 65 °C (149 °F). [11] These capacitors may be rated for 5000, 10000 or 12000 hours of operation at 105 °C (221 °F), extending the projected lifetime in comparison with standard solid capacitors. Air pollution and reliability [ edit]High rates of motherboard failures in China and India appear to be due to \" sulfurous air pollution produced by coal \" that\\'s burned to generate electricity. Air pollution corrodes the circuitry, according to Intel researchers. [12]Bootstrapping using the Basic Input/Output System [ edit]Motherboards contain some non-volatile memory to initialize the system and load some startup software, usually an operating system, from some external peripheral device. Microcomputers such as the Apple II and IBM PC used ROM chips mounted in sockets on the motherboard. At power-up, the central processor would load its program counter with the address of the boot ROM and start executing instructions from the ROM. These instructions initialized and tested the system hardware, displayed system information on the screen, performed RAM checks, and then loaded an initial program from an external or peripheral device. If none was available, then the computer would perform tasks from other memory stores or display an error message, depending on the model and design of the computer and the ROM version. For example, both the Apple II and the original IBM PC had Microsoft Cassette BASIC in ROM and would start that if no program could be loaded from disk. Most modern motherboard designs use a BIOS, stored in an EEPROM chip soldered to or socketed on the motherboard, to booting an operating system. Non-operating system boot programs are still supported on modern IBM PC-descended machines, but nowadays it is assumed that the boot program will be a complex operating system such as Microsoft Windows or Linux. When power is first supplied to the motherboard, the BIOS firmware tests and configures memory, circuitry, and peripherals. This Power-On Self Test (POST) may include testing some of the following things: Video adapter Cards inserted into slots, such as conventional PCIFloppy drive Temperatures, voltages, and fan speeds for hardware monitoring CMOS memory used to store BIOS setup configuration Keyboard and Mouse Network controller Optical drives: CD-ROM or DVD-ROMSCSI hard drive IDE, EIDE, or Serial ATA Hard disk drive Security devices, such as a fingerprint reader or the state of a latching switch to detect intrusion USB devices, such as a memory storage device On recent motherboards the BIOS may also patch the central processor microcode if the BIOS detects that the installed CPU is one for which errata have been published.

       "        {'text': 'Steamed Pear with Rock Sugar â home remedy for cough & sore throat Steamed Pear with Rock Sugar – home remedy for cough & sore throat Posted on May 29, 2014 by Jack29 Comments When I did my grocery shopping few days ago, I saw a big sales for Asian pears. The mountain high pears remind me of a tasty home remedy for cough and sore throat that is common in this season. It is the traditionally famous Steam Pears with Rock Sugar, from the Chinese culture. In my practice, I rarely prescribe Chinese herbal medicine unless it is necessary. My theory is: If the patient is able to feel better with a little home remedy or change in lifestyle and to return the body to the natural balance, why medicine? In direct translation from Chinese classical texts, steam pears with rock sugar have the benefits of to reduce phlegm, clear heat, moisten the lung, and cool the heart. To put this in the modern context, steam pears with rock sugar can help to reduce swollen throat, smooth irritation at throat, reduce cough (especially loud ones), prevent dehydration of respiratory tract, clear phlegm, and reduce fever. In one sentence, it is good for cough with phlegm from common cold or allergy/irritation. From my experience, it is also good for dry cough or dry throat. And, to my surprise, it sometimes helps with constipation that sometimes comes with prolong cough or fever. For elderly or children who are more prone to seasonal flu, this is also a good remedy for flu prevention. One more thing is that pears are in season now, and it is always good to consume food while it is in season. According to USA Pears, most pears are usually in season from fall to early spring. Lets talk about the ingredients. As the name of this remedy, the two core ingredients are pears and rock sugar. Additional ingredients can be added for additional benefits. Here is a short list for the common ones that people usually like to use and can be found in supermarket here in US. Of course, you can always go to the Chinese grocery or herbal shops to look for them. Gou Qi Berries – It is good for people with dry or tired eyes. This is one of the few herbs that boost both yin and yang energy and still taste good, so some people call Gou Qi berries the long life berries. Hence, it is just a wonderful add-on for general health boost. You can read more about this tiny fruit from this article. Yin Er – There are many names to this wonderful fungus. Let me list a few here. Tremella fuciformis, White wood ear, silver ear fungus, snow fungus, white jelly mushrooms, and etc. There are many many benefits of this herb, but the most famous benefit is that it can make your skin look more beautiful. The theory behind it is that this fungus has the function of keeping the respiratory tract and the lung in a good moisture balance and also nourish the yin. Lung, in traditional Chinese medicine, is the organ that control the skin, and yin energy is all about soft, smooth, moist, and etc. Therefore, this herb has the effect to keep the skin soft, smooth, and nicely nourished. In addition, it taste good in sweet soup, so Chinese, especially ladies, like to put this in whenever they are making sweet soup-like dishes. Chen Pi – It is the sun-dried tangerine (mandarin) peel. It is very good to clear phlegm in upper respiratory tract. It also has the benefit to help with bloating after meals, so it is often used in dessert. Lian Zi – The Lotus seed. In addition to its good taste, there are three major benefits. The first is that it is good for condition with chronic diarrhea with low appetite. Second is that it can help with premature ejaculation, and spermatorrhea for man or excessive uterine bleeding and vaginal discharge for women. Third, this is good for anxiety and insomnia. It is important to note that if you have any of the issues listed above, it is recommend to get advice from doctor or a licensed diplomate of oriental medicine. However, as a food, lotus seed is a good hearty food that will make you happier. For the main ingredients, you can use any kind of pears. I have made this remedy with various kinds of pears and all taste good and work well. Of course, my personal favorite is still the Asian pear because it is what I grew up with, but I do not see the reason to travel miles and troubles to get Asian pear. There are two colors for the rock sugar. One is clear and one is yellow. Some say that it is better to use the yellow ones, but in my opinion, whichever you have access to would do the job. The yellow one is usually in irregular shape, so additional effort might be required to break them into smaller pieces. For those who should not eat too much sugar, this dish can be done with little or no sugar. The benefit of the sugar is to help to nourish yin and clear heat, but it can be replace with Yin Er or other ingredients listed above. So, how much of each ingredient is needed for one pear? Normally, I go by feeling, but here is a general guideline for reference.1 pear3 to 8 clear rock sugar or 5g to 10g yellow rock sugar (I once saw a recipe of 40g rock sugar, so you can be your judge on how sweet you want this pear to be. )3g to 10g each for all other ingredients. Usually I don’t put in too many of these as pear should be the main part of this dish. However, you can also make it in a way that pear is just one of the ingredients. Here are the steps to make steam pears with rock sugar: Skin the pear. Cut the top of the pear off, and dig out the seeds. Save the top part as it will serve as the lid in the next step. Put the bottom part of the pear in a bowl. Then place rock sugar and other smaller ingredients such as gou qi berries or chen pi in the whole at the center, and place the top part of the pear back. Place the rest of the ingredients if there is any at the side of the pear. (note: you can use toothpick to hold this two pieces of pear together. )Place the bowl with pear in a steamer and steam for 8 to 15 minutes. It is ready when you see the color of pear is slightly transparent. For those who don’t have the time dig out the seed or want to make more pears at a time without many bowls. You can slide and dice the pears up as how you want it to be served, and place all ingredients together in a big bowl or deep plate. Then follow step 3 to steam the pears. I cook it this way all the time because it is quicker to prepare and I always make it for my whole family when I need to make this dish. If I make too much, I just put the extra in the refrigerator and serve it at room temperature or warm the next day or later in the week. Some say that it actually taste better after being in the refrigerator overnight. This dish can be served anytime throughout the day. For those who is coughing, it is a good idea to eat the whole pear and drink the soup that is generated in the cooking process. For those who are using this for its prevention purpose, half is good enough, and I would still recommend drinking the soup especially for those who use additional ingredients. Alright, this is enough introduction about this steam pear with rock sugar. You can explore your own way of making this dish as it is very easy to make and can be turned into many different interesting dishes.

Will it achieve the same effect for cough relief? Reply Jack March 23, 2015Yes, regular sugar would work just fine, but it might be better to cook without sugar and just add a little honey afterward. Reply Shing Chen March 27, 2015Will just eating uncooked pear for smoothing coughing? Reply Jack April 6, 2015uncooked pear won’t help much with cough, but of course you can give that a try. Reply Rose April 15, 2015What temperature and how lone do we cook it? Reply Rose April 15, 2015Long*Reply Jack April 15, 2015Hi Rose, this is done by steam. It means that under normal condition, the boiling temperature for water is 100 °C (212 °F). It is something you can see when you see air bubbles coming our from the bottom of the pot which becomes steam when reaching air. You should put a steamer on the top of the pot once the the water starts to boil. Let the pear steam for 8 to 15 minutes depending on the size of the pear and your preference of the taste. Reply Mike May 7, 2015HI: I using for dry cough with no phelgm -unproductive. I have Bai mu er, did you said to mix that with pear instead of using sugar? Should I use Bai mu er by itself? In cooking the pear, does that change the property to neutral since fresh pear is cool in properties? I notices that cold food will trigger dry cough worst.thanks Mike Ng Reply Jack May 8, 2015Hi Mike,You can add Bai Mu Er (Yin Er) in addition to the basic ingredients (pear + rock sugar). Please remember to wash Bai Mu Er and soak it in water and cut it into smaller pieces before adding to the dish. Of course, you can also just cook Bai Mu Er by itself, and it should have some positive effects with dry cough in general. If you are just cooking Bai Mu Er, I would recommend just boil it in water as cooking soup, and add honey when it is cooked. I normally prepare my Bai Mu Er in slow cooker and let it cook the whole night when I am sleeping. Pear has the property of cool, and steaming pear does not change this property. However, cool in property and the cold in temperature are different ideas. Of course, sometimes they are very similar, but in this case, you can consider them as different. Since I can’t see you in person, so I can not tell you if pear is okay or not okay for you. In general, steam pear should be okay if you eat it while it is still hot or warm. Best, Jack Reply Marg January 13, 2016Do I need to add water to this recipe? Reply Jack February 23, 2016You don’t need to add water to the bowel, but of course, you need to add water to the steamer. Reply Jin February 20, 2016Can i just boil it? Tx Reply Jack February 23, 2016Well, of course you can boil it, but that would not be called steamed pear with rock sugar. I have try to boiling it before to see how that taste and feel. I still like the taste from steaming, and I feel steaming works better for your sore throat and cough. Reply Stanley March 5, 2016Should it be served cool or warm for best results? Reply Jack March 7, 2016For most cases, it should be served warm for best result. Replylalitha April 29, 2016Can u cook the pear in the pressure cooker. I use a pressure cooker all the time for my other foods Reply Jack May 1, 2016Yes, but they are cooked very quickly in a steamer or normal pot, so you might overcook them in a pressure cooker. Replychoy keong May 28, 2016Can I use microwave oven? How? Reply Jack May 31, 2016I am not sure about the use of microwave oven because I don’t own one and I can’t test it out, but I assume if you know how to steam anything in the microwave oven, you can give it a try. Good luck!Replynat June 3, 2016hi, can i cook red dates with the pear? Reply Jack June 10, 2016Yes Reply Chris July 13, 2016Nice Reply Millie July 24, 2016We went to San francisco Chinatown for all three ingredients – asian pears, the rock sugar, and the mandarin peel. We dont own a steamer but DIYed it by using a wide mouth stock pot of a contraption out of it by stacking a flat plate over a pan of water and letting the bowl of pears sit on the plate while steaming. then covered it ! this way the rock sugar melts a bit slower so it has taken over 15 minutes to completely steam down the rock sugar. Waiting for the results but looking and tasting good !Reply Jess May 8, 2017Hi i tried but the steaming only end up with very little water. Perharps like one small table spoon? Is it right or do i need to add some water in? Reply Jack May 8, 2017Hi Jess, I am not sure how your setup is, but as long as the pear is cook, it is okay. No need to add water. Reply Sallee May 30, 2017I m facing the same thing as well. The liquid is just like the melting of the rock sugar. It don look lik the 1 in the pic Reply Jack May 30, 2017Hi Sallee,Different types of pears at different season contains different level of water in them. And the strength of the steam matters also. I find that stronger steam tend to leave more water in with the pear. However, the key point from this dish is to make sure that the pear is fully cooked through. Or, you can try cut the pears in pieces, it will be easier to steam them fully that way. Reply Rita June 18, 2017Is it OK to use steam pear plus rock sugar plus goji berry for pregnant ladies? Reply Jack June 20, 2017Hi Rita, most likely okay for most cases, but please check with your herbalist locally. Reply Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

       "        {'text': 'History of quantum mechanics From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianavigation search See also: Timeline of quantum mechanics and History of physics10 influential figures in the history of quantum mechanics. Left to right: Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Louis de Broglie, Max Born, Paul Dirac, Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Erwin Schrödinger, Richard Feynman. The history of quantum mechanics is a fundamental part of the history of modern physics. Quantum mechanics\\' history, as it interlaces with the history of quantum chemistry, began essentially with a number of different scientific discoveries: the 1838 discovery of cathode rays by Michael Faraday; the 1859–60 winter statement of the black-body radiation problem by Gustav Kirchhoff; the 1877 suggestion by Ludwig Boltzmann that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete; the discovery of the photoelectric effect by Heinrich Hertz in 1887; and the 1900 quantum hypothesis by Max Planck that any energy-radiating atomic system can theoretically be divided into a number of discrete \"energy elements\" ε ( epsilon) such that each of these energy elements is proportional to the frequency ν with which each of them individually radiate energy, as defined by the following formula:where h is a numerical value called Planck\\'s constant. Then, Albert Einstein in 1905, in order to explain the photoelectric effect previously reported by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, postulated consistently with Max Planck\\'s quantum hypothesis that light itself is made of individual quantum particles, which in 1926 came to be called photons by Gilbert N. Lewis. The photoelectric effect was observed upon shining light of particular wavelengths on certain materials, such as metals, which caused electrons to be ejected from those materials only if the light quantum energy was greater than the work function of the metal\\'s surface. The phrase \"quantum mechanics\" was coined (in German, Quantenmechanik) by the group of physicists including Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, and Wolfgang Pauli, at the University of Göttingen in the early 1920s, and was first used in Born\\'s 1924 paper \"Zur Quantenmechanik\". [1] In the years to follow, this theoretical basis slowly began to be applied to chemical structure, reactivity, and bonding. Contents [ hide ]1 Overview2 Founding experiments3 See also4 References5 Further reading6 External links Overview [ edit]Ludwig Boltzmann \\'s diagram of the I 2 molecule proposed in 1898 showing the atomic \"sensitive region\" (α, β) of overlap. Ludwig Boltzmann suggested in 1877 that the energy levels of a physical system, such as a molecule, could be discrete. He was a founder of the Austrian Mathematical Society, together with the mathematicians Gustav von Escherich and Emil Müller. Boltzmann\\'s rationale for the presence of discrete energy levels in molecules such as those of iodine gas had its origins in his statistical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics theories and was backed up by mathematical arguments, as would also be the case twenty years later with the first quantum theory put forward by Max Planck. In 1900, the German physicist Max Planck reluctantly introduced the idea that energy is quantized in order to derive a formula for the observed frequency dependence of the energy emitted by a black body, called Planck\\'s law, that included a Boltzmann distribution (applicable in the classical limit). Planck\\'s law [2] can be stated as follows: where: I ( ν, T) is the energy per unit time (or the power) radiated per unit area of emitting surface in the normal direction per unit solid angle per unit frequency by a black body at temperature T;h is the Planck constant;c is the speed of light in a vacuum;k is the Boltzmann constant;ν ( nu) is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation; and T is the temperature of the body in kelvins. The earlier Wien approximation may be derived from Planck\\'s law by assuming. Moreover, the application of Planck\\'s quantum theory to the electron allowed Ștefan Procopiu in 1911–1913, and subsequently Niels Bohr in 1913, to calculate the magnetic moment of the electron, which was later called the \" magneton \"; similar quantum computations, but with numerically quite different values, were subsequently made possible for both the magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron that are three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the electron. Photoelectric effect The emission of electrons from a metal plate caused by light quanta (photons) with energy greater than the work function of the metal. The photoelectric effect reported by Heinrich Hertz in 1887,and explained by Albert Einstein in 1905. Low-energy phenomena: Photoelectric effect Mid-energy phenomena: Compton scattering High-energy phenomena: Pair production In 1905, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by postulating that light, or more generally all electromagnetic radiation, can be divided into a finite number of \"energy quanta\" that are localized points in space. From the introduction section of his March 1905 quantum paper, \"On a heuristic viewpoint concerning the emission and transformation of light\", Einstein states:\"According to the assumption to be contemplated here, when a light ray is spreading from a point, the energy is not distributed continuously over ever-increasing spaces, but consists of a finite number of \\'energy quanta\\' that are localized in points in space, move without dividing, and can be absorbed or generated only as a whole. \"This statement has been called the most revolutionary sentence written by a physicist of the twentieth century. [3] These energy quanta later came to be called \" photons \", a term introduced by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926. The idea that each photon had to consist of energy in terms of quanta was a remarkable achievement; it effectively solved the problem of black-body radiation attaining infinite energy, which occurred in theory if light were to be explained only in terms of waves. In 1913, Bohr explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom, again by using quantization, in his paper of July 1913 On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules. These theories, though successful, were strictly phenomenological: during this time, there was no rigorous justification for quantization, aside, perhaps, from Henri Poincaré \\'s discussion of Planck\\'s theory in his 1912 paper Sur la théorie des quanta. [4] [5] They are collectively known as the old quantum theory. The phrase \"quantum physics\" was first used in Johnston\\'s Planck\\'s Universe in Light of Modern Physics (1931). With decreasing temperature, the peak of the blackbody radiation curve shifts to longer wavelengths and also has lower intensities. The blackbody radiation curves (1862) at left are also compared with the early, classical limit model of Rayleigh and Jeans (1900) shown at right. The short wavelength side of the curves was already approximated in 1896 by the Wien distribution law. Niels Bohr \\'s 1913 quantum model of the atom, which incorporated an explanation of Johannes Rydberg \\'s 1888 formula, Max Planck \\'s 1900 quantum hypothesis, i.e. that atomic energy radiators have discrete energy values ( ε = hν ), J. J. Thomson \\'s 1904 plum pudding model, Albert Einstein \\'s 1905 light quanta postulate, and Ernest Rutherford \\'s 1907 discovery of the atomic nucleus. Note that the electron does not travel along the black line when emitting a photon. It jumps, disappearing from the outer orbit and appearing in the inner one and cannot exist in the space between orbits 2 and 3. In 1923, the French physicist Louis de Broglie put forward his theory of matter waves by stating that particles can exhibit wave characteristics and vice versa. This theory was for a single particle and derived from special relativity theory. Building on de Broglie\\'s approach, modern quantum mechanics was born in 1925, when the German physicists Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan [6] [7] developed matrix mechanics and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented wave mechanics and the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation as an approximation to the generalised case of de Broglie\\'s theory. [8] Schrödinger subsequently showed that the two approaches were equivalent. Heisenberg formulated his uncertainty principle in 1927, and the Copenhagen interpretation started to take shape at about the same time. Starting around 1927, Paul Dirac began the process of unifying quantum mechanics with special relativity by proposing the Dirac equation for the electron. The Dirac equation achieves the relativistic description of the wavefunction of an electron that Schrödinger failed to obtain. It predicts electron spin and led Dirac to predict the existence of the positron. He also pioneered the use of operator theory, including the influential bra–ket notation, as described in his famous 1930 textbook. During the same period, Hungarian polymath John von Neumann formulated the rigorous mathematical basis for quantum mechanics as the theory of linear operators on Hilbert spaces, as described in his likewise famous 1932 textbook. These, like many other works from the founding period, still stand, and remain widely used. The field of quantum chemistry was pioneered by physicists Walter Heitler and Fritz London, who published a study of the covalent bond of the hydrogen molecule in 1927. Quantum chemistry was subsequently developed by a large number of workers, including the American theoretical chemist Linus Pauling at Caltech, and John C. Slater into various theories such as Molecular Orbital Theory or Valence Theory. Beginning in 1927, researchers made attempts at applying quantum mechanics to fields instead of single particles, resulting in quantum field theories. Early workers in this area include P. A. M. Dirac, W. Pauli, V. Weisskopf, and P. Jordan. This area of research culminated in the formulation of quantum electrodynamics by R. P. Feynman, F. Dyson, J. Schwinger, and S. Tomonaga during the 1940s. Quantum electrodynamics describes a quantum theory of electrons, positrons, and the electromagnetic field, and served as a model for subsequent quantum field theories. [6] [7] [9]Feynman diagram of gluon radiation in quantum chromodynamics The theory of quantum chromodynamics was formulated beginning in the early 1960s. The theory as we know it today was formulated by Politzer, Gross and Wilczek in 1975. Building on pioneering work by Schwinger, Higgs and Goldstone, the physicists Glashow, Weinberg and Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force, for which they received the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics.

       "        {'text': 'Horizon Zero Dawn Aloy Voice Actress, Main Character Customization Posted on August 30, 2016 by Andrew Scott Horizon Zero Dawn Aloy Voice Actress, Main Character Customization Horizon Zero Dawn is a promising Action/RPG with an open world. The game offers you to play as a girl named Aloy who fights against mechanical dinosaurs. HZD has some resemblance with Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry Primal. Horizon Zero Dawn Character Customization This game offers you single player experience which is rather interesting owing to numerous features of the open world. Horizon Zero Dawn main character name is Aloy. She is the leader of the tribe of people living in distant future where machines dominate the world. She decides to raise Humanity against evil machines and stop hiding from them deep in the forest. She has numerous firearms, bows, daggers and melee combat skills at her disposal. As a typical RPG and Action cross Horizon Zero Dawn character customization options are standard. Before you start story mode, you can choose appearance of your character. Among customized features is shape of the face, eyes, lips etc. You can also choose the colour of her eyes, hair and clothes. Skills of your character depend on the type you choose. Thus, Aloy can be good at silent attacks or an expert at melee combat. Voice Actress Even though most of secrets about the game are still to be revealed, we already know that one of the Horizon Zero Dawn voice actresses is Ashly Burch. She is an American voice actress and writer known for giving her voice to Tiny Tina from Borderlands 2. The girl has also been spotted in Hey Ash, Watcha Playin’ series. However, the cast of other actors is still kept in secret and we are going to learn more about Horizon Zero Dawn voice actors closer to the release date. Another voice actors are Kosha Engler (Solai and Nora voices), Will Bowden whose voice is used for Warrior and other minor characters; Melissa Stavish which is Lotte and Moishe Teichman whose voice used for Mentor. Male Character There is a lot of controversy around male character being the protagonist of the game. Nevertheless, Sony is not going to change this aspect being inspired by Sarah Connor from Terminator and Ripley from Alien. However, there is a possibility that Aloy will have a companion. His name as well as story are kept in disguise. However latest screenshots show Aloy in company of a brutal men with a beard who teaches her how to shoot. He may well be her mentor. It is unlikely that he will play an important part of the story line otherwise Sony would have given more information about him. The possibility is that he will introduce players to the game and teach basic skills. Perhaps, he will be a part of the tutorial and will guide you through the whole game as well.

It is the largest Asian segment restaurant chain in the United States, [5] where it was founded and is mainly located (in addition to other countries and territories in North America and Asia). Panda Express restaurants were traditionally located in shopping mall food courts, but the chain now operates units in many other environments and formats, including stand-alone restaurants, as well as universities, casinos, airports, military bases, amusement parks and other venues. Panda Express has over 2,000 restaurants, located in 50 U. S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates. A typical Panda Express meal: Kung Pao chicken, orange chicken, chow mein and steamed vegetables The chain offers a variety of Chinese-cuisine-inspired dishes (e.g., Orange Chicken; Firecracker Chicken Breast; Beijing Beef; Grilled Teriyaki Chicken; Kung Pao Chicken ). \"Combo meals\" are served with customer\\'s choice of either fried rice, steamed rice, chow mein, or mixed vegetables. No MSG is added to any of the items at Panda Express after it has been delivered to the restaurant, nor does Panda Express purchase from any suppliers who add MSG. [6]Panda Express is headquartered in Rosemead, California. [7] The Panda Express brand is a casual, fast-food variation of corporate sibling Panda Inn (a chain of upscale, table service restaurants). Contents [ hide ]1 History2 International3 Overview4 See also5 References6 Further reading7 External links History [ edit]A typical Panda Express in Fort Worth, Texas (2014)The Panda Restaurant Group, parent company of Panda Inn, Panda Express, and Hibachi-San, was founded by Andrew Cherng and Peggy Cherng and Andrew\\'s father, Master Chef Ming Tsai Cherng. [8] Andrew Cherng and his father are from the Yangzhou region of China \\'s Jiangsu province, while Peggy was born in Burma and raised in Hong Kong. [9] Both Andrew and Peggy Cherng are alumni of Baker University in Baldwin City, Kansas (where they first met). [10] [11] Peggy Cherng received her B. S. degree in applied mathematics from Oregon State University in 1971, and her M. S. in Computer Science and Ph. D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Missouri-Columbia. [12] Andrew Cherng also received his M. S. in Mathematics from the University of Missouri. [13]In 1973, when Andrew\\'s parents moved to the United States, Andrew went into business with his father and opened their first Panda Inn restaurant in Pasadena, California. [9] [10] At the beginning, business was lacking to the degree that Andrew had to offer special deals and freebies so that customers would dine at Panda Inn. [14] In 1982, Peggy joined Andrew in the restaurant business. [9] While operating Panda Inn, Andrew became acquainted with then-UCLA head football coach Terry Donahue, as well as Terry\\'s brother Dan, who happened to be in the real estate business. [9] It was because of this connection that in 1983, Donahue Schriber Real Estate, the manager of the Glendale Galleria, invited the Cherngs to develop a fast-food version of Panda Inn for the Galleria\\'s food court, and Panda Express was launched that October. [15] A second location was opened two years later at the Westside Pavilion in 1985. [16] The chain has steadily expanded across the United States since then. Chef Andy Kao claims to have developed the original Chinese-American orange chicken recipe at a Panda Express in Hawaii in 1987. [17]At first, Panda Express restaurants were found solely in food courts in major shopping malls. [9] During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Cherngs began experimenting with supermarket -based branches, through a deal with Vons, and then stand-alone restaurant locations. [9] In 1997, the company opened its first stand-alone, drive-through restaurant, in Hesperia, California. [18] Today less than 2% of its restaurants are in malls. [19]Because Peggy had worked for several years as a software designer & engineer for defense contractors like Mc Donnell Douglas, Panda Express computerized its operations early on. [9] [10] Peggy also brought a systems analysis perspective to the business and worked through the logistics and standardization issues necessary to scale up the concept. [9] [10]In 2000, they launched Panda Cares to give back to the community. They provide funding, food and volunteer services to children in need and disaster relief efforts. [20]In 2005, Panda Express began to open units in food courts on college campus, some of which participate in the residential student meal plans. [21]In 2008, the Cherngs were the recipients of the City of Angels Award, given by the LAX Coastal Area Chamber of Commerce, [22] for their contributions to the greater Los Angeles area. [23]On November 23, 2009, it was announced that Panda Express had selected Trusonic to provide Asian themed background music to its store locations. [24]On the ABC News TV program Nightline, April 18, 2011, there was a feature segment on Panda Express and its success. The segment described how Andrew Cherng encourages his workers and management to go through self-help programs emphasizing Landmark Education. [25]In June 2013, it was announced that the restaurant chain will pay $150,000 to settle an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission action on behalf of at least three female teenagers who were allegedly sexually harassed between 2007 and 2009 by one male kitchen supervisor in Kauai, Hawaii. [26]In November 2013, Panda Express opened its first location in the western Pacific by opening a location in the American territory of Guam. [27] The first location in the state of Alaska was opened in December 2015. [28]As of 2014, the Panda Restaurant Group had annual sales of over $2 billion and close to 25,000 employees. [29] They also opened Panda Innovation Kitchen in Pasadena with their daughter, Peggy Cherng, overlooking a majority of the restaurant\\'s business. [30] The idea for Panda Innovation Kitchen is to experiment with new flavours and ingredients to come up with new menu items. In addition, they also opened a tea bar to introduce Taiwanese drinks such as boba milk tea and new drinks like the Fortune Cookie Shake. [31]In December 2017, Panda Express had opened the chain\\'s 2,000th location, which is located in New York City near Columbia University. [32]International [ edit]Panda Express also operates in Mexico, Canada, South Korea, and United Arab Emirates. The first location in Mexico opened in that nation\\'s capital of the same name in September 2011. [33]In October 2013, the first Panda Express located in Canada opened its doors on Hunt Club Road in Nepean, Ontario. [ citation needed] The first location in Calgary was opened in October 2016. [34]The first location in South Korea was opened in Seoul in September 2014. [35]On May 26, 2014, it was reported by Arabian Business news that Panda Express would be opening a restaurant in the United Arab Emirates. [36] The first Panda Express restaurant in the Middle East was open in Dubai in November 2014. [37]In July 2016, Panda Express opened its first location in Guatemala, in Guatemala City. [38]Panda Express previously had eight locations in Japan that were operated under a franchise agreement that later lapsed. [15] In November 2016, the company returned to the country by opening a new location in Kawasaki. [39] This new location is operated as part of a joint partnership with Ippudo. [40]Overview [ edit]With approximately 2,000+ [41] locations, it is the largest Chinese fast food restaurant chain in the United States. The company\\'s highest revenue location, bringing in over US$ 4 million annually, is located at the Ala Moana Center food court in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Wondering where your money is? Read on. Lisa Aberle ( Get Rich Slowly)Mar 29, 2015 at 11:05AMApril 15th may be a few weeks away, but I\\'m guessing some of you have already filed your tax return. We, as a matter of fact, just finished our tax return last week. For the second year in a row, we are getting a small refund. (As an aside, we have a large nonrefundable tax credit that is taunting me. Our tax liability wasn\\'t high enough to use much of it, so there it sits...)Whether you are getting a large or small refund this year, you are probably anxious to receive it -- I know I am! Did you know you can check with the IRS to find out what the status of your federal tax refund is? How? I am so glad you asked... Simple, web-based IRS tool lets you check your federal tax refund\\'s status. Considering the complicated tax code, I think it is amazing that this tool is called, quite simply, \" Where\\'s my refund? \" Anyway, you will need to provide your social security number, filing status, and exact -- please note \"exact\" -- refund amount in order for your request to be processed. You can even use the official smartphone app of the IRS ( IRS2Go) to check the status of your refund AND find free tax preparation assistance (if you qualify). You will need to provide the same information to check your refund status whether you use the app or the online tool. The app also provides various hotline numbers to call for various tax issues. Don\\'t have a computer or a smartphone? You can also call the IRS to check the status. However, the IRS phone representatives can only research your refund status if 21 days have passed since you e-filed, or six weeks since you filed a paper return, or if their web-based tool directs you to call them. Plus, they might be a little busy around tax time. Our tax refund will be direct-deposited, but even if you are getting a regular check, this method still works. When can you start checking the status of your tax refund? If you e-file, you can check after 24 hours. If you do a paper-based return, wait four weeks. The IRS states that the online tool is only updated once every 24 hours, so there is no need to check it more often. In general, you can expect your refund about 21 days after you e-file. As I mentioned above, if you haven\\'t received your refund within this time frame, it\\'s time to give the IRS a call. If you\\'re using direct deposit, check with your bank regularly to confirm the refund has been deposited. The IRS will not notify you that the check has been deposited. Want your money more quickly next year? To receive your tax refund more quickly, the IRS recommends e-filing and direct deposit. Even if you choose to do a paper return, make sure your return is free of errors and has your correct mailing address, so the return can be processed -- and the money deposited to your checking account! -- as soon as possible. Want a refund next year? Or not... If you have always received a refund but want to see if you now have the discipline to save on your own, consider adjusting your W-4 so that less is withheld from your paycheck. (The IRS withholding calculator can help you calculate how much you should have withheld.) This will, in essence, spread your refund out over the course of a year. If you have the discipline to use this money wisely, you will have use of it much earlier than if you had waited for a refund. On the other hand, if a tax refund is a method of forced saving you can appreciate, consider having more withheld from your paycheck. As always, do what works for you. And may your check arrive soon!Related links: Which online high-yield savings account & money market account is best?

       "        {'text': 'What is Atorvastatin Calcium is used for: What is Atorvastatin Calcium is used for: Atorvastatin Calcium is used to treat high cholesterol and to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other conditions caused by higher cholesterol levels. It can also be prescribed to help people who may have heart complications corresponding to type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, or other risk factors. Atorvastatin Calcium Classification Atorvastatin Calcium is classified as a “statin,” or HMG Co A reductase inhibitor. The drug increases levels of “good” cholesterol, while reducing levels of “bad” cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. How to use Atorvastatin Calcium: Before using Atorvastatin, be sure to consult your doctor and consider the risks of taking the medicine. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Consider the following before using Atorvastatin Calcium: Allergies Discuss any unusual or allergic reactions to Atorvastatin, or any other medications with your doctor. You should also make your physician aware of any other allergies you might have including food, allergies to dyes, preservatives, or animals. Pediatric Studies performed to date, have not identified any pediatric specific problems that would inhibit the usefulness of Atorvastatin in children. Although, safety and efficacy haven’t been established in children under the age of 10. Geriatric Studies performed to date, have not identified any geriatric specific problems that would inhibit the usefulness of Atorvastatin in the elderly. However, elderly patients should know that age-related muscle problems may be more likely in patients receiving Atorvastatin. Breast Feeding Studies in breastfeeding woman have shown harmful effects to infants. You should stop breastfeeding while using Atorvastatin or have an alternative medication prescribed to you by your doctor. Instructions for use: Use Atorvastatin as directed by your doctor. Check the label on the medicine for exact dosing instructions. Atorvastatin’s packaging comes with an extra patient leaflet. If you have questions in regards to this information, talk to your pharmacist. Atorvastatin should be taken by mouth, with or without food. Atorvastatin should be swallowed whole and not broken, crushed, or chewed before swallowing. Eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice can increase the amount of Atorvastatin in your blood, which in turn may increase your risk of having serious side effects. Your risk may be greater when grapefruit or grapefruit juice is taken in a large amount. Avoid large amounts of grapefruit or grapefruit juice (more than 1 quart daily.) Talk to your doctor and/or pharmacist if you have questions regarding including grapefruit juice in your diet while taking this medication. Do not miss any doses of this medication. Continue to take Atorvastatin, even if you feel well. If you miss a dose of Atorvastatin, take it as soon as possible. Do not take more than 2 doses within a 12 hour time period. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how to use Atorvastatin. Atorvastatin Side Effects: Side effects can exist in all medicines, but many people have no, or minor, side effects. If any of these common side effects persists or become worrisome, be sure to discuss them with your doctor. ', 'score': '-5.36193'},\n",
       "        {'text': \"What Bait Should Be Used for Brim Fishing? What Bait Should Be Used for Brim Fishing? The brim is a member of the sunfish family. It also is called by the name of bluegill, bream and sun perch. Brim will offer at many different types of baits. Brim do not typically exceed a pound and a half in weight. The bait that brim can be caught on will differ with the time of year. Worms One of the most reliable baits for brim is the earthworm or the larger night crawler. These two baits will work well when presented to the brim underneath a fishing float to keep the bait suspended. Fishing on the bottom with a split shot to keep the worm down will allow the angler to have equal success with brim. Whatever method the fisherman chooses she should use a long-shank No. 10 hook. The brim has a smallish mouth and it can be hard to unhook when using a normal hook. Tip the hook with just a tiny segment of worm since the brim will easily pull an entire worm off a hook when it nibbles. Once the brim begin to bite you can actually make the pieces of worm smaller since there will be fierce competition among the brim as soon as the bait hits the water. Worms will entice brim in the spring, summer and fall. Other Live Baits Other live baits that work well on brim are grasshoppers and crickets fished on the top of the water or held beneath the surface with a small split shot attached to the line. Mealworms, maggots, waxworms and redworms on a small jig head hook also will attract brim; these are best fished from a boat in a vertical up and down motion. Brim that are large enough will try to take a small minnow hooked behind its dorsal fin underneath a float. Ice fishermen favor a jig head tipped with either a piece of a minnow or some sort of smaller worm like a waxworm. These are fished on jigging rods through holes drilled in the ice. Artificial Lures The types of artificial lures that brim will respond to are all much smaller than those used for most other species of fish. Soft plastic baits of various colors such as pink and white on a 1/16-oz. jig head will work when fished slowly around cover like stumps and brush piles. Tube jigs, in-line spinner baits, micro-jigs, and ice flies all are proven brim lures. Fly fishermen will utilize nearly any type of fly to catch brim. Small popper flies designed to resemble ants, crickets and spiders are also popular with those who fly fish for brim.

Old English bereærn \"barn,\" literally \"barley house,\" from bere \"barley\" (see barley) + aern \"house,\" metathesized from *rann, *rasn (cf. Old Norse rann, Gothic razn \"house,\" Old English rest \"resting place;\" sealtærn \"saltworks\"). Barley was not always the only crop grown as the data recovered at Bishopstone might suggest but it is always the most commonly represented, followed by wheat and then rye and oats. [C. J. Arnold, \"An Archaeology of the Early Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms,\" 1988, p.36] Another word for \"barn\" in Old English was beretun, \"barley enclosure\" (from tun \"enclosure, house\"), which accounts for the many Barton place names on the English map, and the common surname.

For information relating to trades & services staff, refer section 7)1.1 The ordinary hours of work, spread of ordinary hours, working days and variations to working days for professional staff are determined in accordance with clause 56 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010 .1.2 The standard hours of work for a full-time staff member are 8.45am to 5.00pm which includes a 1 hour lunch break (i.e. 7 hours and 15 minutes per day).1.3 Variations to the standard hours of work can occur where an agreement is made between the department and the staff member (s).1.4 The department, in conjunction with the staff member (s), must keep records of the start and finishing times for audit purposes. These records will be kept within the department.1.5 The different standard hours may include arrangements such as flexi time, nine day fortnight or nineteen day month.1.6 Clause 57 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010 outlines the conditions regarding shift work.2 Flexible working hours – other than library staff2.1 The feasibility of flexible working hours is based on cooperation and trust among staff, supervisors, and management.2.2 Staff levels must be adequate at all times to ensure effective communication and the proper discharge of day-to-day departmental functions and responsibilities.2.3 Deans or heads of departments should apply for approval to the Executive Director Human Resources if they wish to introduce flexible working hours for their professional staff.2.4 The following rules apply to flexible working schemes: Staff must record on a formal timesheet arrival and departure times for the start and finish of work, lunch, and any absences on private business, e.g. medical and dental appointments.staff member working in an area where flexible working hours have been approved may exclude himself or herself from the scheme. Any time worked outside standard hours must be by arrangement between supervisors and staff.2.5 Core time periods when all staff are required to be on duty (except when on approved leave) are 10.00 a.m. - 12 noon and 2.00 p.m. - 4.00 p.m.2.6 For areas other than libraries flexible time periods are:7.30 a.m. - 10.00 a.m. (period during which staff may commence work)12.00 noon - 2.00 p.m. (period during which staff may vary meal break)4.00 p.m. - 6.30 p.m. (period during which staff may leave work)2.7 Staff must be present during core time (unless on scheduled or approved leave) but subject to their duties and the consent of their supervisor, are free to elect hours on duty in flexible periods.2.8 A maximum of 2 days scheduled leave may be taken per 4 weeks by prior arrangement between supervisor and staff member.2.9 The settlement period for flexible working hours is 2 weeks; i.e. 72.50 hours must be worked for each fortnight, between the hours of 7.30 a.m. and 7.30 p.m. Up to 1 day debit or credit may be carried over from 1 fortnight to the next.3 Flexible working hours – library staff3.1 For staff in libraries, flexible time periods are:7.30 a.m. - 10.00 a.m.12.00 noon - 2.00 p.m.4.00 p.m. - 7.30 p.m.3.2 For staff in libraries, core time (periods when all staff are required to be on duty, except when on approved leave) are 10.00 a.m. - 12.00 noon and 2.00 p.m. - 4.00 p.m.3.3 Clause 57 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010 will not apply and a shift allowance will not be payable to staff who work flexi-time and commence work before 7.30am.3.4 All staff must be on duty during core times (unless on scheduled or approved leave), or unless special permission has been given by the supervisor to vary core time because of special duties required outside of core time.3.5 A maximum of 2 days may be taken off within one settlement period by staff members who have previously accumulated credit to cover leave.3.6 A staff member who does not have sufficient previously-accumulated credit carry-over, may take a maximum of 1 day in anticipation.3.7 Settlement period consists of a 4-week period within which staff must work 145 hours subject to the credit/debit and carry-over provisions.3.8 Staff members in the Baillieu Library are required to swipe their cards in the time-recording device at the beginning of a work period (i.e. arriving at work, returning from meal break) and swipe their card through the time-recording device at the end of a work period (i.e. leaving for meal break, finishing work).4 Changes in hours of work or working days4.1 A staff member's time commitment to the University is established in his or her contract of employment.4.2 Circumstances such as increased hours to meet seasonal work demands, or to compensate for the absence of another staff member may dictate a change to a staff member's time commitment.4.3 The University has a scheme for fractional or part-time employment prior to retirement (see Leaving the University Procedure). Approved staff participating in this scheme may continue superannuation contributions at the full-time rate as detailed in the Superannuation Procedure.4.4 A staff member may negotiate with their head of department to increase or decrease their time commitment.4.5 Increases must be approved by a level 2 delegate but only where funds are available.4.6 Changes to a staff member’s time commitment must be approved by the staff member and may be made on a continuing basis, or for a specified period.4.7 A Time Fraction Change form, approved by a level 2 delegate must be submitted to the local HR consultant with the following information:the name, employee number and title of the staff memberthe date of the first day of the change in time commitmentif applicable, the date of the last day of the period to which the change appliesthe number of the University position the staff member occupies andthe specific details of the alteration.4.8 The level 2 delegate should consult with the head of budget division if there are budgetary consequences.4.9 Where there is a change in time commitment, a manager, when re-negotiating the employment contract, may require the staff member to nominate a retirement date, if relevant to the particular situation. A change in time commitment means a change in the employment contract.4.10 A staff member who works less than full-time, may negotiate with their supervisor to change their actual working day (s) or the number of hours actually worked on their existing working days, provided there is no overall increase or decrease in their overall time commitment. Such changes may be made on a continuing basis, or for a specified period and must have the staff member's approval.4.11 The information required regarding a change in working days must be submitted to the local HR officer on the Time Fraction Change form, with the supervisor's (level 1 delegation) approval.5 Overtime provisions5.1 Overtime provisions are determined in accordance with clause 58 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010.5.2 All overtime must be approved by a level 2 delegate or above, prior to the staff member working any extra time.5.3 Overtime should be processed by the department through Themis Self-Service.5.4 A member of professional staff is eligible to be paid for overtime worked at the relevant overtime rate, when they are directed to work over and above the ordinary number of weekly hours in accordance with the overtime provisions, and their substantive classification is at or below HEW level 6.5.5 Overtime is payable to casual professional staff at HEW level 6 or below, in respect of work in excess of 7.25 hours on one day. The staff member will receive the greater of the overtime rate that would apply to overtime worked on that day by an equivalent full-time staff member or the casual loading, but not both.5.6 Any additional hours worked in excess of 7.25 hours per day, where the casual is being paid at HEW level 7 or above, will be paid at time and a half with the casual loading.5.7 The rates at which a professional staff member (excluding trades and services staff), who is eligible for paid overtime, will be paid for all work performed in excess of or outside the ordinary hours is outlined in clause 58.7 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010.5.8 Time off in lieu (TOIL) and return to duty provisions are determined in accordance with clause 58 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010.5.9 A professional staff member who is directed to work over and above the ordinary number of weekly hours and whose substantive classification is at or above that of HEW level 7 will be eligible to claim time off in lieu (TOIL) calculated at one and a half times the actual hours worked.5.10 The staff member must document the hours worked, provide these details to their supervisor within five working days and discuss with their supervisors their arrangements for taking time off in lieu.5.11 A travelling allowance will be payable if a staff member who is eligible to receive an overtime payment, is directed to work overtime and to start and/or finish at times when the usual means of transport between the home and place of work is not available.5.12 The travelling allowance will be equal to the difference between the normal cost of the travel and the cost incurred through the use of a reasonable alternative means of transport.5.13 Professional staff members who are not eligible to receive payment for overtime, will be reimbursed for all reasonable travelling expenses incurred if directed to work other than their ordinary hours of duty.5.14 Professional staff required to work beyond 9.00 pm are entitled to take a taxi home, if they would otherwise have to travel home by public transport, or for whom no safe option for transport home exists. Taxi vouchers are available on request to the head of department, otherwise a staff member will be reimbursed for the cost of the taxi fare on presentation of a receipt.5.15 Meal and tea breaks are in accordance with clause 55 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010.5.16 Time taken as a meal break must be clearly indicated in Themis HR or on the Payroll Adjustment form and not included when an overtime payment is assessed.5.17 Local work areas may agree to vary the timing of meal and tea breaks to maximise operational and personal flexibility.6 Additional work for full-time professional staff and research assistants6.1 Subject to the approval of the head of department where the staff member is employed, full-time professional staff and full-time research assistants may undertake additional casual work:in other departments of the Universityin their own department, where that work is not part of their normal day-time duties.6.2 The duties of the position to which the staff member is appointed take precedence over the additional work, and the work undertaken will normally be outside the ordinary hours of work. Staff cannot be directed to undertake additional casual work under these arrangements.6.3 Staff will be paid for additional casual work at either:the casual rate appropriate to the duties being undertakena rate approved by University Council for the work undertaken (eg. conferring ceremonies).6.4 If additional work is required, and full-time professional staff are directed to undertake it, those staff members must be paid overtime rates if they are classified at HEW level 6 or below.6.5 A staff member who undertakes additional casual work must be given a Contract of Employment for Casual Staff form, which specifies the type of employment and informs the employee of the term of engagement at the time of the appointment.7 Trades and services conditions - Property and Campus Services staff only7.1 In addition to any other allowances outlined in this procedure, professional staff employed by Property & Campus Services may be entitled to the allowances listed in Schedule B of the Higher Education Industry – General Staff – Award 2010 at the rates prescribed in that Award.7.2 Schedule 2 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010 outlines the provisions which apply to the following professional trades and services staff employed in the Property and Campus Services (PCS): builders, carpenters, labourers, electricians, electrical mechanics, gardeners or horticultural technicians, mechanical / electrical technicians, painters, plasterers, plumbers and trades assistants.7.3 The ordinary hours of work and spread of ordinary hours for professional trades and services staff are as per clause 3 of Schedule 2 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010.7.4 Overtime and time off in lieu (TOIL) provisions as per clause 4 of Schedule 2 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010.7.5 Where the University requires a staff member to work overtime, a 10 hour break will be provided, wherever reasonably practical, prior to the next ordinary period of duty without loss of pay.7.6 Call out rates will be paid to staff eligible under Schedule 2, Clause 5.1 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010 for all work performed outside the ordinary hours prescribed and calculated on a daily basis.7.7 A staff member who is eligible under Schedule 2, Clause 5.1 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010 and who is required to hold him or herself in readiness to work after ordinary hours shall be paid a standing by allowance ( Schedule B - Professional Staff Salaries and Rates of Payment ).7.8 Professional staff employed by PCS may also be entitled to the allowances listed in Schedule B of the Higher Education Industry – General Staff – Award 2010 at the rates prescribed in that Award.7.9 Clauses 6 and 7 of Schedule 2 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010 provide other conditions regarding licenses, registration and tools.7.10 The 9-day fortnight and 19-day fortnight are available for the professional staff as listed within the following sections: The following trades and services staff employed on the Parkville campus may work under a nine-day fortnight arrangement. The objective of this arrangement is to ensure a more flexible local rostering system which will enable the needs of the client to be better met.builderscarpenterslabourerselectrical mechanicselectricianselectrical/ mechanical technicianspaintersplasterersplumberstrades assistants Gardeners and horticultural technicians will work a 19 day month in accordance with existing local arrangements.7.11 Managers of staff working under a nine-day fortnight arrangement will finalise a yearly roster in consultation with staff members prior to the end of the current year roster:the banking and use of rostered days off (RDOs) to a maximum of 2 days, will be by agreement between the manager and the staff membermanagers, after consultation with the staff member concerned, will be able to re-schedule RDOs to suit the operational needs of the Universitystaff members, after consultation and agreement with their manager, will be able to change RDOs due to personal circumstancesexcept for exceptional circumstances, managers or staff members should provide at least 5 working days notice prior to any proposed changes to RDOs.8 Workload management8.1 Workloads for all staff will be determined in accordance with clause 51 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010.8.2 Heads of budget divisions, in consultation with the heads of department in the budget or equivalent and other staff in the budget division, will develop and implement a workload model:that reflects the work undertaken by the areais consistent with the seven workload principles within clause 51.2 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010includes a method of calculating comparative workloads of staffis regularly reviewed and forms part of the Performance Development Framework review and feedback discussions.8.3 The Workload Advisory Committee has produced guidelines to further assist with developing an effective academic workload model: Principles for an Effective Academic Workload Allocation Model.8.4 Clause 51.6 provides a guideline to maximum annual hours of academic work. Allocated hours in this context are hours that the University directs the staff member to work, including any hours the staff member would reasonably require to undertake any research or scholarly activity directly related to the staff member’s appointment at the University.8.5 Prior to the start of each semester or summer term, an academic staff member and their supervisor will discuss:the number of teaching contact hours per week required of the staff member during that teaching period andthe proportion of research, teaching, knowledge partnership activities and leadership and service activities expected of the individual in that teaching period.8.6 An academic staff member may have one standard teaching period per calendar year free of teaching (other than postgraduate supervision), provided thatthe staff member uses that time for research relevant to the staff member’s discipline areathe operational requirements of the staff member’s budget division can reasonably be met. A standard teaching period is limited to the standard semesters of an academic year (semester 1 and semester 2) and the summer term.8.7 Academic budget divisions are to develop discipline-specific workload models that accord with clause 51 and with the University’s guidelines - Academic Workload Models: Guidelines for Faculties and Graduate Schools - as amended from time-to-time.8.8 Heads of budget divisions will certify, in accordance with the University's annual certification of accounts process, that the budget division’s workload management model is consistent with the principles outlined in clause 51 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010. The certification will include a description of how the workload principles have been applied.8.9 The process for addressing staff concerns about workloads is set out in clause 52 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010.8.10 The role and membership of the Workload Advisory Committee, which will meet at least four times a year to monitor workload regulation, and provide a central point of reference for advice on the development of budget division workload models is set out in clause 53 of the University of Melbourne Collective Agreement 2010.

       "        {'text': 'Daniele NaviglioÂ» 7.Volumetric analysis Volumetric analysis Volumetric analysis is an analytical method or procedure for working out the titre or concentration of an analyte in a solution. This is done by measuring the volume of a standard solution of an appropriate reagent whose precise concentration is already known. The procedure is based on the reaction between the solution referred to as the titrant and the analyte which is referred to as the titrand. The most common way of carrying out this procedure is to put the unknown solution in an Erlenmeyer flask and then, using a burette, slowly add the titrant to it. This technique is known as titration. How to position the burette and beaker for titration Titration Is based on various reactions:neutralisation;precipitation;complexation;redox. Features of titration:the reaction it is based on has to be complete (the equilibrium must move to the right);the reaction has to be fast;we have to know the stoichiometry of the reaction;the end point of the titration must be identifiable and reproducible. The titre The titre is the concentration of the reactive. As you should know, concentration can be expressed in various ways (see opposite). Equivalence point We have already seen how titration is carried out by slowly adding standard solution using a burette to an analyte solution until the reaction between the two can be said to be completely finished. But how can we tell when titration is complete? The answer to this is when the equivalents of the titrant and the analyte are the same i.e. have reached their equivalence point. The equivalence point is the point of titration where the amount of titrant is exactly that dictated by the stoichiometry of the analyte. The equivalence point is the ideal result in titration. In effect, what is measured is the end point of a sudden variation in the pysical or chemical property of a solution. Chemical and physical changes associated with the equivalence point of a titrationthe analyte or the substance which is added specially (termed an indicator) changes colour;there is clouding or turbidity in the solution because of the formation of an insoluble phase;the electric conductivity of the solution changes;there is a change in the potential difference between two electrodes immersed in the solution;the refraction index of the solution changes;there is a temperature change;there is a variation in the amount of current that passes through the solution. Titration curves Theoretical titration curves can be mapped out for all kinds of titrations. They serve to explain the theory behind the end point as well as where errors occur. They are graphs with volume of the reagent on the x axis and a function of the analyte or reagent concentration on the y axis. The curve is normally a sigmoid one and the area of interest is limited to that around the equivalence point ( (da ±0,1 a ±0,5 m L). Titration curve. Strong acid with strong base. Source: itchiavari.org Equivalence point and end point The equivalence point of a titration is a theoretical point which cannot be determined by experiment. We can only guess where it lies by observing physical changes associated with equivalence. These changes are known as the end point of a titration. The difference in volume (taken as an absolute value) between the equivalence point and the end point is the titration error. E i= V ep– V eq E i: titration error V ep: actual volume used to reach end point V eq: theoretical volume of reagent needed to reach equivalence point Indicators The end point of titration is usually found using an indicator. An indicator is a compound, or a mix of compounds, which undergoes very visible changes, usually to the colour, in response to specific chemical environments. Instruments, as well as indicators, can also be used to reveal the equivalence point (Instrumental Analytical Chemistry). These respond to characteristic changes in the properties of solutions during titration. They include voltameters, ammeters, ohmmeters, colorimeters, p H meters, temperature recorders and refractometers. Chemical characteristics of indicators used in titration Standard solutions The validity of an analytical procedure depends on knowing how much reagent has been used. It is possible to work out the exact known concentration of a titrant.primary standard (parent substance): is a sufficiently pure compound that can be used to prepare a standard solution by weighing out (Gravimetric analysis) a certain amount and then diluting it to a defined volume of solution in a volumetric flask.secondary standard: a susbstance whose concentration is determined by reference to a primary standard. Characteristics of primary standardsvery pure (>99,9%);stable in air;reasonably soluble in titration;sufficiently high equivalent weight to make weighing error neglible;readily-available and inexpensive. Primary standards for different types of titration Example: preparation of a sodium carbonate solution of known concentration Imagine that we want to prepare 5.000 L of a Na 2 CO 3 (105,99 g/mol) solution at 0.1000 M of solid primary standard. Since the volume is expressed in litres the calculation is worked out in moles rather than millimoles. Calculation of amount of sodium carbonate to be weighed Secondary standards In the majority of cases titrants are not available in primary standard form. A solution of the titrant at the desired concentration is therefore used instead to titrate a known mass of primary standard. Example: preparing an HCL solution at a concentration of approx. 0.1 MSuppose that we want to prepare 1.000 L of a 0.1 M of HCL solution (36.465 g/mol). Since hydrochloric acid is not a primary standard we need to prepare a solution at approx. the right concentration and then titrate it with a parent substance (Standardisation). Pure hydrochloric acid concentrate for analysis is marketed as an aqueous solution and its level of purity (37%) and density (1.185 g/ml) is indicated on the label. Calculating amount in weight of hydrochloric acid Example: preparing an HCL solution at a concentration of approx. 0.1 M (cont. )All we have to do then is take 8.3 ml of this solution using a calibrated pipette and put it into a calibrated 1 L volumetric flask and bring it up to volume with distilled water. As we mentioned before, the solution cannot be defined as precisely 0.1 N but approx. 0.1 N so it needs to be standardised. To get the exact concentration, the solution needs to be standardised through titration with a primary standard like sodium carbonate. Here we need to take a sufficient amount of sodium carbonate to contain enough equivalents to react with 20-25 ml of the solution to be standardised which is contained in a burette. In this case the titrant is the solid parent substance which, after being weighed, is put in an Erlenmeyer flask while the titrand is the solution in the burette. Calculating the volume of hydrochloric acid concentrate to be used Example: standardisation of a 0.1 M HCL solution Suppose we have a 0.1 M HCL solution and a Na2CO3 solution at a known concentration of 0.112 N. Since we know that to standardise 10 ml of HCl we used 11.2 ml of Na 2 CO 3, what is the exact known titre of the HCL solution? V 1* N 1= V 2* N 2Where: V 1: volume of titrant used N 1: concentration of titrant expressed in normality V 2: volume del titrand N 2: concentration of titrand (unknown)Standardisation of an HCL solution Therefore: V 1: 11.2 m L C 1: 0.112 mol/L V 2: 10 m L C 2: X mol/L11,2 m L * 0.112 M = 10 m L * X MX = 0.125 MTitration of the example given Diluting solutions of known concentration It is very important to know, and to know how to apply, the law regarding the dilution of solutions. Suppose we ant to dilute a 0.1 molar solution of HCL by 1/10. Once again we need to apply the formula: V 1* C 1= V 2* C 2Where: V 1: X m L C 1: 0.1 M V 2: 100 m L (volume arbitrarily chosen) C 2: 0.01 MX m L * 0.1 M = 100 m L * 0.01 M X = 10 m LTherefore we take 10 m L of a 0.1 M HCl solution using a calibrated pipette and put it into a 100 ml volumetric flask and then bring it up to volume (liquid reaches the ring graduation line) by adding deionised water.

Spoke with costco warranty dept and they cannot get EHS (the repair company) to call them back. I have not received a call from them either. What kind of repair service does not answer their phone or call back?? Costco should consider changing repair companies.

Sep. 29, 2014-by rosie Costco in Central ILI LOVE Costco!!! I recently moved from Chicago to central Illinois and the closest Costco is 2 hours away in Peoria. Please consider building in Decatur, Springfield, Bloomington, or Champaign. Decatur has a perfect location currently for sale -- it was a stable with riding trails in Decatur bordering Mt. Zion -- the land is owned by the Decatur Park District. Perfection location and a lots of space!!! Decatur only has Walmart, Kroger, and Sam\\'s Club here. . . and the Sam\\'s Club stinks! Costco would be a great addition!Aug. 28, 2014-by Cathy Need drug test I have been a member of the Avon, Ohio location for Several years! I was very uncomfortable with my last visit to the location when two employees both female were speaking aloud of exchanging marijuana during an upcoming break. I wouldn\\'t have cared as much if my two children weren\\'t present at the moment and could clearly hear the conversation. One females possible black or Hispanic was speaking very loud! It\\'s embarrassing to know I spend so much money in that establishment and the employees are that comfortable to speak of abusing drugs during work shifts. You would think they would drug test them. I will not be retuning to that establishment. Nor will my two business partners. Aug. 9, 2014-by Heather Thank You Costco My experience with your company has been nothing but great. Your products are great, your prices unbeatable and you staff always go that extra mile to be of service to the customer. Your pharmacy staff are very courteous and always have been there for me. Even if I just call to get info. for an over the counter med. they take the time to make a recommendation and whatever else I need. Mainly I want to thank you Costco for making my prescriptions affordable. Aug. 9, 2014-by Miriam Eterginio America Obviously the CEO hasn\\'t read it, or if he has he doesn\\'t understand it.

Has anyone noticed the irony with this situation and the title of the book? \"America: Imagine a world without her\" This situation could be titled, \"America (the book): Imagine Costco without her\" Our family has been Costco members for 20 years.

Has anyone noticed the irony with this situation and the title of the book? \"America: Imagine a world without her\" This situation could be titled, \"America Can costco imagine having lost so many customers without her?\" Our family has been Costco members for 20 years. We\\'re happy now to ONLY patronize our Sam\\'s club, and will be mailing our membership cards to the corporate office. Jul. 12, 2014-by Hugo Schraer Which is worse?

       "        {'text': \"What does low blood pressure mean and what causes it? Health Diseases & Conditions Heart Diseases What does low blood pressure mean and what causes it? Is it dangerous?2 following 7 answers Answers Relevance Rating Newest Oldest Best Answer: MEANING OF LOW BLOOD PRESSURE: Low blood pressure is defined primarily by signs and symptoms of low blood flow. In fact, some individuals may have a blood pressure of 90/50 and have no signs or symptoms of low blood pressure, and, therefore, not have low blood pressure while others who normally have a blood pressure of 130/80 may develop symptoms and signs of low blood pressure if their blood pressure drops to 100/60. CAUSES: Low blood pressure due to low blood volume: * Dehydration is common among patients with diarrhea who lose large amounts of water in their stool, particularly when drowsiness limits their drinking of fluids or is associated with nausea and vomiting. Dehydration also can occur with prolonged vomiting of any cause because of the loss of water in the vomitus. Other causes of dehydration include exercise, sweating, fever, and heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Individuals with mild dehydration may experience only thirst and dry mouth. Moderate to severe dehydration may cause orthostatic hypotension (manifest by light-headedness, dizziness or fainting upon standing). Protracted and severe dehydration can lead to shock, kidney failure, confusion, acidosis (too much acid in the blood), coma, and even death. For more, please read the Dehydration article. * Moderate or severe bleeding can quickly deplete an individual’s body of blood, leading to low blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension. Bleeding can result from trauma, surgical complications, or from gastrointestinal abnormalities such as ulcers, tumors, or diverticulosis. Occasionally, the bleeding may be so severe and rapid (for example, bleeding from a ruptured aortic aneurysm) that it causes shock rapidly. * Severe inflammation of organs inside the body such as acute pancreatitis can cause low blood pressure. In acute pancreatitis, fluid leaves the blood to enter the inflamed tissues around the pancreas as well as the abdominal cavity, depleting the volume of blood. Causes of low blood pressure due to heart disease * Weakened heart muscle can cause the heart to fail and reduce the amount of blood it pumps. One common cause of weakened heart muscle is the death of a large portion of the heart’s muscle due to a single, large heart attack or repeated smaller heart attacks (please read the Heart Attack article for more). Other examples of conditions that can weaken the heart include medications that are toxic to the heart, infections of the muscle of the heart by viruses (myocarditis), and diseases of the heart’s valves such as aortic stenosis. * Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart). Pericarditis can cause fluid to accumulate within the pericardium and around the heart, restricting the ability of the heart to pump blood. * Pulmonary embolism is a condition in which a blood clot in a vein (a condition called deep vein thrombosis) breaks off and travels to the heart and eventually the lung. A large blood clot can block the flow of blood into the left ventricle from the lungs and severely diminish the ability of the heart to pump blood. Pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening emergency. For more, please read the Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism article. * A slow heart rate (bradycardia) can decrease the amount of blood pumped by the heart. The resting heart rate for a healthy adult is between 60 and 100 beats/minute. Bradycardia (resting heart rates slower than 60 beats/minute) does not always cause low blood pressure. In fact, some highly trained athletes can have resting heart rates in the 40’s and 50’s without any symptoms. (The slow heart rates are offset by more forceful contractions of the heart that pump more blood than in non-athletes.) But in many patients bradycardia can lead to low blood pressure, light-headedness, dizziness, and even fainting. One example of bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, occurs common in the elderly. This syndrome is due to degeneration of the sinus node (SA node), an area in the heart that generates electrical signals that cause the heart to beat regularly. In the sick sinus syndrome, the diseased SA node cannot generate signals fast enough to maintain a normal heart rate. Another condition that causes bradycardia is heart block. Electrical signals from the SA node must travel to the rest of the heart’s muscle to cause the heart to contract and pump blood. Normally these electrical signals are transmitted along special tissues in the heart. Heart block occurs when these specialized tissues are damaged by heart attacks, degeneration that occurs with aging, and medications. Heart block prevents some or all of the electrical signals generated by the SA node from reaching the rest of the heart, and this prevents the heart from contracting as rapidly as it otherwise would. * An abnormally fast heart rate (tachycardia) also can cause low blood pressure. The most common example of tachycardia causing low blood pressure is atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a disorder of the heart characterized by rapid and irregular electrical discharges from the muscle of the heart (instead of the SA node), causing the ventricles to contract irregularly and (usually) rapidly. The rapidly contracting ventricles do not have enough time to fill maximally with blood before the each contraction, and the amount of blood that is pumped decreases, in spite of the faster heart rate. Other abnormally rapid heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia also can produce low blood pressure, sometimes even life-threatening shock. For more, please read the Atrial Fibrillation article. Medications that cause low blood pressure * Medications such as calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and digoxin (Lanoxin) can slow the rate at which the heart contracts. Some elderly people are extremely sensitive to these medications since they are more likely to have diseased SA nodes and electrical conduction tissues. In some individuals, the heart rate can become dangerously slow even with small doses of these medications. * Medications used in treating high blood pressure (such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha-blockers) can excessively lower blood pressure and result in symptomatic low blood pressure especially among the elderly. * Diuretics (water pills) such as furosemide (Lasix) can decrease blood volume by causing excessive urination. * Medications used for treating depression, such as amitriptyline (Elavil), Parkinson’s disease, such as levodopa-carbidopa (Sinemet), erectile dysfunction (impotence), such as sildenafil (Viagra) when used in combination with nitroglycerine, can cause low blood pressure * Alcohol and narcotics also can cause low blood pressure. Other condition s that cause low blood pressure * Vasovagal reaction is a common condition in which a healthy person temporarily develops low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and sometimes fainting. A vasovagal reaction typically is brought on by emotions of fear or pain such as having blood drawn or starting an intravenous infusion. Vasovagal reactions are caused by the involuntary (autonomic) nervous system releasing hormones that slow the heart and widen the blood vessels. * Postural (orthostatic) hypotension, as discussed previously, is a sudden drop in blood pressure when an individual stands up from a sitting, squatting, or supine (lying) position. When a person stands up, gravity causes blood to settle in the veins in the legs, hence less blood reaches the heart for pumping, and, as a result, the blood pressure drops. The body normally responds automatically to the drop in blood pressure by increasing the rate at which the heart beats and by narrowing the veins to return more blood to the heart. In patients with postural hypotension, this compensating reflex fails to occur, resulting in symptomatic low blood pressure. Postural hypotension can occur in persons of all ages but is much more common among the elderly, especially in those on medications for high blood pressure and/or diuretics. Other causes of postural hypotension include dehydration, adrenal insufficiency (discussed shortly), prolonged bed rest, diabetes that has caused damage to the autonomic nerves, alcoholism with damage to the autonomic nerves, and certain rare neurological syndromes (e.g., Shy-Drager syndrome) that damage the autonomic nerves. * Another form of postural hypotension occurs typically in young healthy individuals. After prolonged standing, the individual’s heart rate and blood pressure drops, causing dizziness, nausea and often fainting. In these individuals, the autonomic nervous system wrongly responds to prolonged standing by directing the heart to slow down and the veins to dilate. * Micturition syncope is a temporary drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness brought about by urinating. This condition typically occurs in elderly patients and may be due to the release by the autonomic nerves of hormones that lower blood pressure. * Adrenal insufficiency, for example, due to Addison’s disease, can cause low blood pressure. Addison’s disease is a disorder in which the adrenal glands (small glands next to the kidneys) are destroyed. The destroyed adrenal glands can no longer produce sufficient adrenal hormones (specifically cortisol) necessary for to maintain normal bodily functions. Cortisol has many functions, one of which is to maintain blood pressure and the function of the heart. Addison’s disease is characterized by loss of weight, muscle weakness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and, sometimes, darkening of the skin. * Septicemia is a severe infection in which bacteria (or other infectious organisms such as fungi) enter the blood. The infection typically originates in the lungs (as pneumonia), bladder, or in the abdomen due to diverticulitis or gallstones. The bacteria then enter the blood where they release toxins and cause life-threatening and profound low blood pressure (septic shock), often with damage to several organs. * Anaphylaxis (anaphylactic shock) is a potentially fatal allergic reaction to medications such as penicillin, intravenous iodine used in some x-ray studies, foods such as peanuts, or bee stings. In addition to a profound drop in blood pressure, individuals may also experience hives, wheezing, and a swollen throat with difficulty breathing.

Learn here https://tr.im/ks TA9 Many people with hypothyroidism experience crippling fatigue and brain fog, which prompts reaching for non-nutritional forms of energy like sugar and caffeine. I’ve dubbed these rascals the terrible twosome, as they can burn out your thyroid (and destabilize blood sugar). 1. Just say no to the dietary bungee cord. Greatly reduce or eliminate caffeine and sugar, including refined carbohydrates like flour, which the body treats like sugar. Make grain-based carbohydrates lesser of a focus, eating non-starchy vegetables to your heart’s content. 2. Up the protein. Protein transports thyroid hormone to all your tissues and enjoying it at each meal can help normalize thyroid function. Proteins include nuts and nut butters; quinoa; hormone- and antibiotic-free animal products (organic, grass-fed meats, eggs, and sustainably-farmed fish); and legumes.? · 2 years ago0 0 Comment6Source (s): Cure Neuropathy http://renditl.info/Neuropathy Solution Pr...? · 1 year ago0 0 Comment5Source (s): Cure Impotence http://Impotence Treatment.latis.info/?st...? · 1 year ago0 0 Comment4Source (s): Hypothyroidism Treatments http://Hypothyroidism Revolution.emuy.inf...? · 1 year ago0 0 Comment Hi, I was a neuropathy sufferer.

Rosenberg, The Associated Press Published 11:18 a.m. ET May 10, 2015 (Photo: Seth Wenig, AP)CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORENEW YORK — Take a product on a home shopping channel and sell out in a matter of minutes— it\\'s the dream of many entrepreneurs. Lori Greiner, who\\'s sold her jewelry organizers, home decor and other products on QVC since 1998, encourages other entrepreneurs to try to get on air. Greiner, who\\'s an investor on the ABC program \"Shark Tank,\" has also brought some of the products she\\'s invested in to QVC. \"The products that do the best solve a problem — there\\'s a need for them,\" says Greiner, who\\'s been called the Queen of QVC. A home shopping appearance is also a way to advertise to a large audience. QVC says it reaches nearly 100 million households in the U. S. and 300 million worldwide through broadcast, cable and satellite programming. QVC rival Home Shopping Network says it reaches 95 million U. S. households and another competitor, Evine, reaches 88 million. Latest World & National News & Headlines - USATODAY.com About 850 to 900 products appear on air on QVC weekly. The company\\'s website, QVC.com, has tens of thousands of products, most of which have also sold on air. \"You get to show people within minutes what your product is, and you can sell thousands of units within minutes,\" Greiner says. HOW TO GET ONEntrepreneurs can try to sell to QVC even if they don\\'t have finished products. Prototypes work fine. Greiner showed buyers a prototype for her first plastic organizer for earrings in 1996. After she inked deals with Home Shopping Network and J. C. Penney, he began making her product. HOW DO YOU FIND A BUYER? Exhibit at trade shows like the International Home & Housewares Show in Chicago or the National Hardware Show in Las Vegas. Another way in is to send a pitch to the company via its website or hire a salesperson known as a manufacturer\\'s representative. Networking also helps: Some of QVC\\'s current vendors have introduced other business owners to the company\\'s buyers, says Ken O\\'Brien, QVC\\'s senior vice president of merchandising. WHAT WORKS? Kitchen gadgets and other products that can be demonstrated play well on TV. Clothing or beauty products that a model shows off also appeal to viewers. Products like toasters that aren\\'t very exciting might not make it on air, but they could still be sold on qvc.com, O\\'Brien says. DO YOUR OWN MARKET RESEARCHMarket research is important and it doesn\\'t have to be expensive. Greiner took her earring organizer to the streets before marketing it to companies. \"I went up to people in all different types of neighborhoods,\" she says. \"They answered basic questions: Do you like this? What would you pay for this? \"THE GREINER EFFECTCorda Roy\\'s bean bag chair sales quadrupled after Greiner invested in the company and brought it to QVC in 2013. It was owner Byron Young\\'s second try with QVC; an agent helped him get his first appearance several years earlier, but the chairs didn\\'t sell well and he wasn\\'t invited back. Greiner offers mentoring and advice to help improve sales, Young says. She has recommended that he change fabrics to make the bean bags look fresh to viewers despite repeated QVC appearances. \"Her experience is really helping. I probably wouldn\\'t think that way,\" he says. AND THEN THERE\\'S PLAIN OLD LUCKFor other entrepreneurs, being in the right place at the right time was key to selling on QVC. Jamie Kern, who hasn\\'t worked with Greiner, got her IT Cosmetics on air after QVC buyers and one of the shopping channel\\'s hosts saw her products at a trade show in 2010. Kern had tried unsuccessfully for two years to sell to QVC, submitting samples. During her first appearance her products sold out and IT Cosmetics was on air four more times that year; in 2014, they appeared more than 250 times. Kern won\\'t say how much of her sales come from QVC, but her revenue, which also includes sales from the IT website and Ulta cosmetics stores, has increased from about $1 million in 2010 to $200 million in 2014. THE PAYOFFGreiner remembers her first time on a home shopping channel, when she had 2,500 earring organizers to sell. \"I sold out in four minutes,\" she says.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (April 2010) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)A CT for operation on a 110 k V grid A current transformer ( CT) is a type of transformer that is used to measure alternating current (AC). It produces a current in its secondary which is proportional to the current in its primary. Current transformers, along with voltage or potential transformers, are instrument transformers. Instrument transformers scale the large values of voltage or current to small, standardized values that are easy to handle for instruments and protective relays. The instrument transformers isolate measurement or protection circuits from the high voltage of the primary system. A current transformer provides a secondary current that is accurately proportional to the current flowing in its primary. The current transformer presents a negligible load to the primary circuit. Current transformers are the current-sensing units of the power system and are used at generating stations, electrical substations, and in industrial and commercial electric power distribution.

In principle, the only difference between a current transformer and a voltage transformer (normal type) is that the former is fed with a \\'constant\\' current while the latter is fed with a \\'constant\\' voltage, where \\'constant\\' has the strict circuit theory meaning. The alternating current in the primary produces an alternating magnetic field in the core, which then induces an alternating current in the secondary. The primary circuit is largely unaffected by the insertion of the CT. Accurate current transformers need close coupling between the primary and secondary to ensure that the secondary current is proportional to the primary current over a wide current range. The current in the secondary is the current in the primary (assuming a single turn primary) divided by the number of turns of the secondary. In the illustration on the right, \\'I\\' is the current in the primary, \\'B\\' is the magnetic field, \\'N\\' is the number of turns on the secondary, and \\'A\\' is an AC ammeter. Current transformers typically consist of a silicon steel ring core wound with many turns of copper wire as shown in the illustration to the right. The conductor carrying the primary current is passed through the ring. The CT\\'s primary, therefore, consists of a single \\'turn\\'. The primary \\'winding\\' may be a permanent part of the current transformer, i.e. a heavy copper bar to carry current through the core. Window-type current transformers are also common, which can have circuit cables run through the middle of an opening in the core to provide a single-turn primary winding. To assist accuracy, the primary conductor should be centered in the aperture. CTs are specified by their current ratio from primary to secondary. The rated secondary current is normally standardized at 1 or 5 amperes. For example, a 4000:5 CT secondary winding will supply an output current of 5 amperes when the primary winding current is 4000 amperes. This ratio can also be used to find the impedance or voltage on one side of the transformer, given the appropriate value at the other side. For the 4000:5 CT, the secondary impedance can be found as Z S= NZ P= 800Z P, and the secondary voltage can be found as V S= NV P= 800V P. In some cases, the secondary impedance is referred to the primary side, and is found as Z S′ = N 2Z P. Referring the impedance is done simply by multiplying initial secondary impedance value by the current ratio. The secondary winding of a CT can have taps to provide a range of ratios, five taps being common. Current transformer shapes and sizes vary depending on the end user or switch gear manufacturer. Low-voltage single ratio metering current transformers are either a ring type or plastic molded case. Split-core current transformers either have a two-part core or a core with a removable section. This allows the transformer to be placed around a conductor without having to disconnect it first. Split-core current transformers are typically used in low current measuring instruments, often portable, battery-operated, and hand-held (see illustration lower right). Use [ edit]Many digital clamp meters utilize a current transformer for measuring alternating current (AC). Current transformers are used extensively for measuring current and monitoring the operation of the power grid. Along with voltage leads, revenue-grade CTs drive the electrical utility\\'s watt-hour meter on virtually every building with three-phase service and single-phase services greater than 200 amperes. High-voltage current transformers are mounted on porcelain or polymer insulators to isolate them from ground. Some CT configurations slip around the bushing of a high-voltage transformer or circuit breaker, which automatically centers the conductor inside the CT window. Current transformers can be mounted on the low voltage or high voltage leads of a power transformer. Sometimes a section of a bus bar can be removed to replace a current transformer. Often, multiple CTs are installed as a \"stack\" for various uses. For example, protection devices and revenue metering may use separate CTs to provide isolation between metering and protection circuits and allows current transformers with different characteristics (accuracy, overload performance) to be used for the devices. The burden (load) impedance should not exceed the specified maximum value to avoid the secondary voltage exceeding the limits for the current transformer. The primary current rating of a current transformer should not be exceeded or the core may enter its non linear region and ultimately saturate. This would occur near the end of the first half of each half (positive and negative) of the AC sine wave in the primary and would compromise the accuracy. Safety [ edit]Current transformers are often used to monitor high currents or currents at high voltages. Technical standards and design practices are used to ensure the safety of installations using current transformers. The secondary of a current transformer should not be disconnected from its burden while current is in the primary, as the secondary will attempt to continue driving current into an effective infinite impedance up to its insulation break-down voltage and thus compromise operator safety. For certain current transformers, this voltage may reach several kilovolts and may cause arcing. Exceeding the secondary voltage may also degrade the accuracy of the transformer or destroy it. Energizing a current transformer with an open circuit secondary is equivalent to energizing a voltage transformer (normal type) with a short circuit secondary. In the first case the secondary tries to produce an infinite voltage and in the second case the secondary tries to produce an infinite current. Both scenarios can be dangerous and damage the transformer. Accuracy [ edit]The accuracy of a CT is affected by a number of factors including: Burden Burden class/saturation class Rating factor Load External electromagnetic fields Temperature Physical configuration The selected tap, for multi-ratio CTs Phase change Capacitive coupling between primary and secondary Resistance of primary and secondary Core magnetizing current Accuracy classes for various types of measurement and at standard loads in the secondary circuit (burdens) are defined in IEC 61869-1 as classes 0.1, 0.2s, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5s, 1 and 3. The class designation is an approximate measure of the CT\\'s accuracy. The ratio (primary to secondary current) error of a Class 1 CT is 1% at rated current; the ratio error of a Class 0.5 CT is 0.5% or less. Errors in phase are also important, especially in power measuring circuits. Each class has an allowable maximum phase error for a specified load impedance. Current transformers used for protective relaying also have accuracy requirements at overload currents in excess of the normal rating to ensure accurate performance of relays during system faults. A CT with a rating of 2.5L400 specifies with an output from its secondary winding of twenty times its rated secondary current (usually 5 A × 20 = 100 A) and 400 V (IZ drop) its output accuracy will be within 2.5 percent. Burden [ edit]The secondary load of a current transformer is termed the \"burden\" to distinguish it from the primary load. The burden in a CT metering circuit is largely resistive impedance presented to its secondary winding. Typical burden ratings for IEC CTs are 1.5 VA, 3 VA, 5 VA, 10 VA, 15 VA, 20 VA, 30 VA, 45 VA and 60 VA. ANSI/IEEE burden ratings are B-0.1, B-0.2, B-0.5, B-1.0, B-2.0 and B-4.0. This means a CT with a burden rating of B-0.2 will maintain its stated accuracy with up to 0.2 Ω on the secondary circuit. These specification diagrams show accuracy parallelograms on a grid incorporating magnitude and phase angle error scales at the CT\\'s rated burden. Items that contribute to the burden of a current measurement circuit are switch-blocks, meters and intermediate conductors. The most common cause of excess burden impedance is the conductor between the meter and the CT. When substation meters are located far from the meter cabinets, the excessive length of cable creates a large resistance. This problem can be reduced by using thicker cables and CTs with lower secondary currents (1 A), both of which will produce less voltage drop between the CT and its metering devices. Knee-point core-saturation voltage [ edit]The knee-point voltage of a current transformer is the magnitude of the secondary voltage above which the output current ceases to linearly follow the input current within declared accuracy. In testing, if a voltage is applied across the secondary terminals the magnetizing current will increase in proportion to the applied voltage, until the knee point is reached. The knee point is defined as the voltage at which a 10% increase in applied voltage increases the magnetizing current by 50%. [ citation needed] For voltages greater than the knee point, the magnetizing current increases considerably even for small increments in voltage across the secondary terminals. The knee-point voltage is less applicable for metering current transformers as their accuracy is generally much higher but constrained within a very small range of the current transformer rating, typically 1.2 to 1.5 times rated current. However, the concept of knee point voltage is very pertinent to protection current transformers, since they are necessarily exposed to fault currents of 20 to 30 times rated current. [1]Phase shift [ edit]Ideally, the primary and secondary currents of a current transformer should be in phase. In practice, this is impossible, but, at normal power frequencies, phase shifts of a few tenths of a degree are achievable, while simpler CTs may have phase shifts up to six degrees. [2] For current measurement, phase shift is immaterial as ammeters only display the magnitude of the current. However, in wattmeters, energy meters, and power factor meters, phase shift produces errors. For power and energy measurement, the errors are considered to be negligible at unity power factor but become more significant as the power factor approaches zero. At zero power-factor, any indicated power is entirely due to the current transformer\\'s phase error. [2] The introduction of electronic power and energy meters has allowed current phase error to be calibrated out. [3]Construction [ edit]Bar-type current transformers have terminals for source and load connections of the primary circuit, and the body of the current transformer provides insulation between the primary circuit and ground. By use of oil insulation and porcelain bushings, such transformers can be applied at the highest transmission voltages. Ring-type current transformers are installed over a bus bar or an insulated cable and have only a low level of insulation on the secondary coil. To obtain non-standard ratios or for other special purposes, more than one turn of the primary cable may be passed through the ring. Where a metal shield is present in the cable jacket, it must be terminated so no net sheath current passes through the ring, to ensure accuracy. Current transformers used to sense ground fault (zero sequence) currents, such as in a three-phase installation, may have three primary conductors passed through the ring. Only the net unbalanced current produces a secondary current - this can be used to detect a fault from an energized conductor to ground. Ring-type transformers usually use dry insulation systems, with a hard rubber or plastic case over the secondary windings. For temporary connections, a split ring-type current transformer can be slipped over a cable without disconnecting it. This type has a laminated iron core, with a hinged section that allows it to be installed over the cable; the core links the magnetic flux produced by the single turn primary winding to a wound secondary with many turns. Because the gaps in the hinged segment introduce inaccuracy, such devices are not normally used for revenue metering. Current transformers, especially those intended for high voltage substation service, may have multiple taps on their secondary windings, providing several ratios in the same device. This can be done to allow for reduced inventory of spare units, or to allow for load growth in an installation. A high-voltage current transformer may have several secondary windings with the same primary, to allow for separate metering and protection circuits, or for connection to different types of protective devices. For example, one secondary may be used for branch overcurrent protection, while a second winding may be used in a bus differential protective scheme, and a third winding used for power and current measurement. Special types [ edit]Specially constructed wideband current transformers are also used (usually with an oscilloscope) to measure waveforms of high frequency or pulsed currents within pulsed power systems. Unlike CTs used for power circuitry, wideband CTs are rated in output volts per ampere of primary current. If the burden resistance is much less than inductive impedance of the secondary winding at the measurement frequency then the current in the secondary tracks the primary current and the transformer provides a current output that is proportional to the measured current. On the other hand, if that condition is not true, then the transformer is inductive and gives a differential output. The Rogowski coil uses this effect and requires an external integrator in order to provide a voltage output that is proportional to the measured current. Standards [ edit]Ultimately, depending on client requirements, there are two main standards to which current transformers are designed. IEC 61869-1 (in the past IEC 60044-1) & IEEE C57.13 (ANSI), although the Canadian and Australian standards are also recognised. [ who?] [ citation needed]High voltage types [ edit]Current transformers are used for protection, measurement and control in high-voltage electrical substations and the electrical grid. Current transformers may be installed inside switchgear or in apparatus bushings, but very often free-standing outdoor current transformers are used. In a switchyard, live tank current transformers have a substantial part of their enclosure energized at the line voltage and must be mounted on insulators. Dead tank current transformers isolate the measured circuit from the enclosure. Live tank CTs are useful because the primary conductor is short, which gives better stability and a higher short-circuit current rating. The primary of the winding can be evenly distributed around the magnetic core, which gives better performance for overloads and transients. Since the major insulation of a live-tank current transformer is not exposed to the heat of the primary conductors, insulation life and thermal stability is improved. A high-voltage current transformer may contain several cores, each with a secondary winding, for different purposes (such as metering circuits, control, or protection). [4] A neutral current transformer is used as earth fault protection to measure any fault current flowing through the neutral line from the wye neutral point of a transformer.

Welcome to the world of UTI! But there\\'s hope! No reason to suffer through this infection, and don\\'t worry about running to the doctor. When you’re doubled over from the pain of a urinary tract infection, it’s good to know that you have options. While antibiotic drugs can bring relief from pain and other UTI symptoms, certain UTI home remedies can help, too. It\\'s true, food remedies have a place in your home treatment plan. Sure, a whole host of drugs are available to treat UTIs, and they can help you feel better in as little as 48 hours. But in order to be treated with an effective drug, you have to have your urine tested at the doctor’s office which is not always possible. There are more ways to fight a urinary tract infection than taking an antibiotic. Home remedies can be just as fast and often times faster, and they\\'re possible for you to use anytime, even if you are on vacation. Food cures are as simple to use as running to the nearest grocery store, and you don\\'t need an appointment. These home remedies can ease your agonizing UTI symptoms and heal the infection often times faster than a prescription, so before you rush to your doctor, browse my home treatment options below. What Causes a UTI? Bacteria is a type of germ that gets into your urinary tract and causes a UTI. This can happen in many ways: Wiping from back to front after a bowel movement. Germs can get into your urethra, which has its opening in front of the vagina. Having sexual intercourse can cause germs in the vagina to be pushed into the urethra. Waiting too long to pass urine. When urine stays in the bladder for a long time, more germs are made, and the worse a UTI can become. Certain forms of birth control like using a diaphragm, spermicides (creams that kill sperm) or on a condom. Anything that makes it hard to completely empty your bladder, like a kidney stone. Having diabetes, which makes it harder for your body to fight other health problems. Loss of estrogen and changes in the vagina after menopause. Menopause is when you stop getting your period. Using had a catheter, a thin tube put through the urethra into the bladder used to drain urine during a medical test and for people who cannot pass urine on their own. Diagnosing a Urinary Tract Infection Although it may be tempting to pick up the phone and ask your doctor to call in a prescription for an antibiotic when you think you have symptoms of a UTI, it’s always better to make sure that is what you are experiencing. Your doctor will want you to go into the office to test your urine to make a confirmation and to learn which type of bacteria is causing the infection. However it is not always possible to get to the doctor when you have an issue, so check out these signs of a UTI listed below:. Signs of a UTI Infection: Pain or stinging when you pass urine. An urge to pass urine a lot, but not much comes out when you go. Pressure in your lower belly. Urine that smells bad or looks milky, cloudy, or reddish in color. If you see blood in your urine, tell a doctor right away. Feeling tired or shaky or having a fever. How UTIs Are Treated Doctors treat most UTIs with oral antibiotics, and typically treatment lasts about seven days. When you use antibiotics, they are basically like a nuclear bomb going off in your system, killing both bad and GOOD bacteria, which can cause issues. These \"good\" bacteria, known as gut flora, support immunity and proper digestion. Your intestines contain around 100 trillion bacteria of various strains, and while some can be deadly, there’s a natural balance in the gut that can be thrown out of whack by antibiotics. Aggressive antibiotics, while helpful if you have a serious infection, can wipe out many good gut bacteria, yet leave those immune to antibiotics left to flourish. Many people, especially children, are vulnerable to unwelcome side effects of unnecessary antibiotics, including lasting changes to their gut flora. Yeast infections are very common after the use of antibiotics in women, and using antibiotics too often can cause bacteria to become resistant to them, says Yvonne Koch, MD, assistant professor of urology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. That said, if you are choosing to take antibiotics for your infection, you can see an improvement in your symptoms within 48 hours of beginning treatment, and it’s important to continue taking the medication until you’ve finished the entire course. The treatments below are items you can find in your home to help take care of the problem no matter what type of bacteria caused it, and won\\'t cause your body to become resistant to further treatment. Get More Garlic and Onions I have used these two items successfully for years now, and actually because I consume all of the items on this list regularly, I haven\\'t had a UTI in a decade or so. Garlic and onions help fight urinary tract infections because of their antimicrobial activity that kills bacteria such as E. coli, and other microorganisms to prevent them from growing in the body. Garlic & onions are also very rich in anti-inflammatory compounds, the most known is allicin, but they contain many other sulfur compounds that are going to wipe out the bad bacteria as well. When you consume garlic & onions, they release active ingredients into the blood stream, and because your blood is going to get filtered by your kidneys, excess moisture and other chemical compounds are going to pass through your urinary tract. This allows the antibiotic agents to help tremendously in controlling the bad bacteria population. Drinking Cranberry Juice Cranberries contain hippuric acid that helps prevent bacteria from clinging to the urethra. Two studies published in the Canadian Journal of Microbiology and Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces revealed that cranberry powder can inhibit the bacterium Proteus mirabilis, commonly found in complicated urinary tract infections. Research by chemical engineering scientists at Montreal\\'s Mc Gill University, showed that increasing the concentration of cranberry powder reduced the bacteria\\'s production of an enzyme that helps the infection spread. Previous studies from the same Mc Gill laboratory found that cranberry materials limit the movement of bacteria found in UTIs, and the movement of bacteria is a key mechanism for the spread of infection. In a review of 10 studies that involved 1,049 people, women who took cranberry supplements had a significantly lower risk of getting UTIs than women who took a placebo. Be sure to drink unsweetened cranberry juice to avoid excess sugar that can cause more bacteria and calories to cause weight gain. You can use Stevia In The Raw or Monk Fruit to make the unsweetened version more palatable. Aim for 16 to 32 ounces a day, or try taking 400 milligrams of a cranberry supplement each day. Drink More Water While cranberry juice is fantastic at helping a UTI, one of the other most important things you can drink when you have a urinary tract infection is water. It helps flush the bacteria away, says Holly Lucille, ND, a naturopathic physician in private practice in West Hollywood, Calif., and author of Creating and Maintaining Balance: A Woman’s Guide to Safe, Natural Hormone Health. Try drinking half of your body weight in ounces of water, up to 80 ounces a day. If you weigh 120 pounds, for example, aim for 60 ounces. Fight Bad Bacteria With Good Bacteria (Probiotics)Greek Yogurt, Kefir, Miso and other fermented foods contains probiotics, which are good bacteria that helps to keep bad bacteria in check, and limit or help cure UTIs, says Kandis Rivers, MD, a urologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Mich. It’s always a good idea to eat yogurt/kefir regularly, but it’s particularly important if you’re taking an antibiotic for UTI treatment, which can wipe out your body’s good bacteria as I mentioned above. Probiotics are not only helpful for urinary tract infections, but researchers found that they can help the body fight many other infections. All yogurt starts out with healthy bacteria, but some yogurts contain extra bacteria that are beneficial for the gut. Get More Vitamin CAs an antioxidant, vitamin C keeps your bladder and urethra healthy and working well. It also makes your urine more acidic, which helps prevent bacteria from growing and causing UTIs. The highest recommended dose for adults is 2000 milligrams per day, but for an acute UTI, you may want to try a higher doses for a few days. Because of potential side effects of high doses of vitamin C, it\\'s important to check with your doctor before you try higher doses. Snack on Blueberries Blueberries are cousins of cranberries and another strong antioxidant food that can help keep your body healthy and free of infection. It’s helpful to eat blueberries regularly, but when you’re looking for a medicinal effect, you need to consume even more. By drinking 100% blueberry juice within the first 24 hours after UTI symptoms begin, you should notice that your symptoms start to decrease. I like adding half a cup of frozen blueberries or more to my morning smoothie. Ban The Burn with Baking Soda If painful, burning urination is a problem for you during a UTI, some experts recommend drinking a glass of water mixed with about half of a teaspoon of baking soda to help with UTI symptoms, however, some believe cranberries are a better food source to turn to. Other Ways To Soothe Your Symptoms Soothe the pain with heat - If inflammation and irritation from UTIs cause burning, pressure, and pain around your pubic area, try applying a heating pad to help soothe the area. Keep the heat setting low, and limit it to 15 minutes at a time to avoid burns. Cut out irritants - Things like caffeine, alcohol, spicy food, nicotine, carbonated drinks, and artificial sweeteners can irritate your bladder further and make it hard for your body to heal. Focus on healthy foods, such as high-fiber, complex carbohydrates and healthy fats like olive oil, which are good for your digestive health. Keep emptying your bladder - Every time you urinate, even if it’s just a small amount, you rid it of some of the bacteria that’s causing the infection. So keep making those bathroom runs. Try herbal remedies - You may find some relief from taking the herb urva ursi, which works as an anti-inflammatory. In addition, the herbs goldenseal and Oregon grape root can help your body fight E. coli, a common bacteria that causes UTIs. However, be sure to tell your doctor about any herbs you’re taking, because side effects can sometimes be serious. At A Glance Guide To Curing Your UTIPrevious article FYI!

       "        {'text': 'What is the Best to Feed a Chipmunk? Chipmunks in the wild live off of the land, so their diet varies based on what is available. When determining what to feed a chipmunk, it\\'s important to understand his natural feeding habits and keep his diet close to natural. Of course, what they eat in the wild is relative to where they live, what season it is and what is plentiful in nature. Nutty Choice Chipmunks feed off of nuts and seeds, which are generally the best choices when feeding your chipmunk. The type of nuts depends on the location. For instance, chipmunks in the south may feed on pecans and peanuts, whereas chipmunks in other areas may only have acorns, or oak nuts, and hickories available. Seeds in a chipmunk’s diet come from trees and flowers that include sunflowers, maples, beech, dogwood and sweetgum, according to the Fairfax County Public Schools website. Veggies for Me Fruits and vegetables also make up the chipmunk\\'s diet. Chipmunks often seek out strawberries, blackberries and other berries that grow close to the ground. Vegetables and grains in the chipmunk\\'s diet consist of the same vegetables many humans eat, including squash and corn. In the wild, chipmunks choose vegetables easy to reach, wreaking havoc on garden growers. Living Food In the wild, chipmunks practice survival of the fittest and eat other living creatures. They often feed on insects, snails, worms and slugs that are land-dwellers. Additionally, eating baby birds, snakes, eggs and mice is not out of the question for chipmunks, as stated on the Fairfax County Schools website. They also eat small frogs and salamanders in the wild. In captivity, however, chipmunks may turn their noses up when offered live food. Eating Habits Chipmunks feed up to six times a day, eating a small meal each time. They use their strong teeth to gnaw and chew and often store extra food in their cheeks. During the winter, the chipmunk does not hibernate but sleeps more than usual and may eat less often since his choices are often limited. He generally survives off food, like acorns and nuts, he stockpiled during the warm months and any passing creature he can find.

       "        {'text': 'Direct and Indirect Object Direct and Indirect Object What is an object? An object in grammar is a part of a sentence, and often part of the predicate. It refers to someone or something involved in the subject \\'s \"performance\" of the verb. It is what the verb is being done to. As an example, the following sentence is given: Subject Verb Object Leila wrote the poem\" Leila \" is the subject, the doer or performer,\" wrote \" is a verb that refers to the action,\" the poem \" is the object involved in the action. Transitive and intransitive verbs A verb can be classified as transitive or intransitive according to whether it takes or doesn\\'t take an object: If a verb takes objects, then it is a transitive verb. Example: They played soccer. → (The verb play takes ONE object \\' soccer \\') They sent him a postcard. → (The verb send takes TWO objects \\' him and \\' a postcard \\')If a verb doesn\\'t take an object, then it is an intransitive verb. Example: She lies. → (The verb \\' lie \\' doesn\\'t take any object) The building collapsed. → (The verb \\'collapse\\' doesn\\'t take any object)Types of objects There are two types of objects: direct and indirect objects: Direct object A direct object answers the question \"what?\" or \"whom? \"Examples: David repaired his car → his car is the direct object of the verb repaired. ( What did David repair? )He invited Mary to the party → Mary is the direct object of the verb invited. (Whom did he invite? )Indirect Object An indirect object answers the question \"to whom? \", \"for whom? \", \"for what?\"... An indirect object is the recipient of the direct object, or an otherwise affected participant in the event. There must be a direct object for an indirect object to be placed in a sentence. In other words an indirect object cannot exist without a direct object. Examples: They sent him a postcard - him is the indirect object of the verb sent. (To whom did they send a postcard? )He bought his son a bike - his son is the indirect object of the verb bought.

The cooperative, coordinated undertaking of sales and marketing functions ensures the realization of optimal revenue from customers or clients. Accordingly, a primary function of a sales department is coordinating its efforts to dovetail with those of the marketing department. A sales department must develop and implement a protocol to sell a product or service that is suitable to the nature of that product or service while connecting it with prospective customers or clients. For example, some products or services require face-to-face interaction between a member of a sales team and a consumer to achieve a sale.

One way of measuring a country's wealth is through its GDP (Gross Domestic Product). The following are the world's15 wealthiest countries by gross domestic product (at purchasing power parity) per capita. Using the purchasing power parity (PPP) value of all final goods to show true value of dollar within a country in a given year. Oil nations dominate the list, as well as a few that may be surprises. All figures in this article are taken from the latest 2017 numbers according to the International Monetary Fund.15. Bahrain - $51,845 GDP (PPP) per capita Bahrain, an island country in the Persian Gulf, enjoys a per capita income of $51,845, making it the world's 15th richest country. Furthermore, Bahrain is home to one of the world's fastest growing economies. Although the economy is still rather dependent on oil - petroleum processing is the country's most popular export - Bahrain has been diversifying its economy to include sectors such as service and tourism.14. Iceland - $52,150 GDP (PPP) per capita This European island country, found in the North Atlantic Ocean, has a per capita income of $52,150. Iceland is a highly developed country with a population that hovers around 300,000. Though the country has a small population, its residents enjoy a high quality of life, with access to high quality education and universal healthcare. The major components of Iceland's economy include software production, biotechnology, and tourism (ecotourism in particular).13. Netherlands - $53,581 GDP (PPP) per capita With 16.8 million people and a per capita GDP of $53,581, the Netherlands is more than just a country known for its beautiful tulips. Its success comes from three key sectors: mining, agriculture, and manufacturing. Many people do not know that the Netherlands is actually a kingdom of four countries: Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands and Sint Maarten. However, the Netherlands makes up 98% of the total land area in the Kingdom.12. Saudi Arabia - $55,262 GDP (PPP) per capita The economy of Saudi Arabia is mainly oil-based, with strong government control over major economic activities. The country's GDP (PPP) per capita is $55,262. Saudi Arabia possesses 18% of the world's proven petroleum reserves and ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum. It played a leading role in OPEC for many years. The petroleum sector accounts for almost all of Saudi government revenues and export earnings. Despite possessing the largest petroleum reserves in the world, its per capita income is much smaller than of that of smaller Persian Gulf neighbors.11. United States - $59,495 GDP (PPP) per capita While most nations on the list have (relatively) small populations, it is impressive that the world's largest economy, the United States, can maintain a per capita GDP (PPP) of $59,495, considering its population of over 310 million people. Reasons behind its success include its large domestic automotive industry, a technological sector that fosters innovation, and a system of democracy that protects entrepreneurial and intellectual property rights.10. San Marino - $60,358 GDP (PPP) per capita The tiny European microstate of San Marino holds the designation of being the world's tenth richest country, with the average personal income coming in at $60,358. Major industries in San Marino include banking, tourism, electronics, and wine and cheese production. Notably, San Marino holds no national debt. Around half of its economy is fueled by tourism.9. Switzerland - $61,359 GDP (PPP) per capita The GDP (PPP) per Swiss citizen is $61,359. Swiss banking and financial institutions keep this country and its economy afloat. It is important to note that some of the wealthiest people and companies in the world own Swiss bank accounts and therefore Switzerland has excess capital to use for investment purposes. Zurich and Geneva, Switzerland's most well-known cities, have consistently ranked among the top ten worldwide in terms of standards of living.8. The United Arab Emirates - $68,245 GDP (PPP) per capita This Middle Eastern federation of emirates has a land area of about 32,278 sq. miles, which means it could easily fit within New York State (54,556 sq. miles). With a population of 9.2 million people, it's a bit more populated than the state of New Jersey. Roughly one third of the $68,245 per capita economy comes from oil revenues, while the service sector and telecommunications also contribute significantly. The UAE is the second largest economy in the Arab world after Saudi Arabia.7. Kuwait - $69,669 GDP (PPP) per capita Kuwait hosts a small, relatively open economy and its citizens enjoy a per capita GDP (PPP) of $69,669. The highest-valued currency unit in the world currently is the The Kuwaiti dinar. With nearly 10% of the world's oil reserves, petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP and 95% of export revenues and government income. In recent years, Kuwait has done little to diversify its economy due to a very positive fiscal situation.6. Norway - $70,590 GDP (PPP) per capita This Nordic nation's per capita GDP of $70,590 allows its 4.97 million people to reap the benefits of a small yet robust economy. Driven by fishing, natural resources, and major petroleum exploration, Norway is the eighth largest exporter of crude oil, 9th largest exporter of refined oil, and 3rd largest exporter of natural gas in the world. Norway also consistently ranks among the world's best places to live.5. Ireland - $72,632 GDP (PPP) per capita The Emerald Isle has a per capita income of about $72,632 with a population of about 4.8 million people. The main industries that boost its economy are textiles, mining, and food production - staple products in any economy. In OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development) rankings, Ireland actually places 4th overall.4. Brunei - $76,743 GDP (PPP) per capita Brunei, a small country in southeast Asia, has an economy that is a mixture of foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation and welfare measures, and village tradition. This has led to GDP per capita (PPP) of $76,743. It is almost completely supported by exports of crude oil and natural gas. Like other oil countries in the list the government has shown progress in diversifying the economy away from just oil and gas.3. Singapore - $90,531 GDP (PPP) per capita This tiny city-state has moved up from 5th position to take 3rd with per capita income (PPP) of $90,531, which is five times the average per capita income for an ordinary individual in the world. The basis of Singapore 's wealth is its financial services sector, a chemical export industry, and its liberal economic policies that encourage growth and innovation. Singapore has the second busiest port in the world, exporting $414 billion of goods in 2011 alone.2. Luxembourg - $109,191 GDP (PPP) per capita A symbol of wealth, Luxembourg takes second place with a per capita GDP (PPP) of $109,191. This is nine times the world average. The backbone of this strong economy is its vibrant financial sector, prudent fiscal policies, and dynamic industrial and steel sectors. Banking in Luxembourg is the largest sector of its economy with an asset base of over $1.24 trillion alone.1. Qatar - $124,927 GDP (PPP) per capita Qatar is the richest country in the world with a per capita income of $124,927. Qatar has a well-developed oil exploration industry where the petroleum industry accounts for 70% of its government revenue, 60% of its GDP and 85% of its export earnings. Although the size of Qatar's GDP is barely within the top 50th largest in the world, the country's relatively low population of two million results in a large GDP per capita, where most residents of the country enjoy a very high standard of living.

       "        {'text': \"Newborn Baby Sleep and Feeding Schedule Newborn Baby Sleep and Feeding Scheduleby Emily De Jeu in Schedules — 12 Comments This article outlines newborn sleep patterns and habits, as well as sample newborn sleep and feeding schedules. Skip to the schedules Newborn Sleep A baby is considered a newborn from birth until about 3 months of age. During the first 3 months of life, your newborn’s sleep patterns will look nothing like yours – your baby will sleep in short bursts (anywhere from 30 or 45 minutes – 3 or possibly 4 hours), and then eat between sleeps. In this way, newborn’s don’t follow a typical day/night sleep schedule. Their circadian rhythms need time to adjust – in fact, some newborns come out of the womb having their days and nights completely mixed up! This is called day/night confusion, and babies who struggle with it tend to sleep a lot during the day and then wake up frequently at night. Many parents discover that their newborns are extra sleepy in the first week or two after birth – you may find that you have to wake your newborn to feed, or that your newborn often drifts off during a feeding, before eating her fill. But your newborn will definitely “wake up” within three weeks after birth – at that point, you will start to deal with more wakefulness (in fact, you may start to miss the early weeks of having a super-sleepy newborn!!). Newborn Feeding Newborns feed very, very frequently, but this isn’t a problem to be solved – it’s perfectly natural! Your newborn’s tummy is quite small, so it’s understandable that he needs to eat often. Formula-fed newborns may need to eat slightly less often than breast-fed newborns, because it takes a newborn’s tummy longer to digest and break down formula, resulting in baby feeling fuller for longer periods of time. Breast milk, on the other hand, is digested fairly quickly. As for how much breastmilk or formula your baby needs – when it comes to formula, you can use a fairly simple formula to help you determine approximately how much formula your baby needs. Take your baby’s weight and multiply it by 2.5. So, following this approach, an 8 pound baby would need about 20 ounces of formula in a 24-hour period. As for breastmilk – as a general rule, most newborns need between 20 and 30 ounces of breastmilk (and between 25-35 ounces once they’re past the newborn stage). In general, if you are exclusively nursing, it’s best to nurse on demand in the first few weeks after birth – this will ensure that your milk supply becomes well-established. In the first 12 weeks, your newborn may have one 4-5 hour stretch of sleep during the day or night, but your baby really shouldn’t have more than one (or possibly two, in some cases) – in order to maintain your supply, you’ll need to nurse every 2-3 hours, on average. Once your baby is past 3 months of age, and is in the infant stage, that will slowly stretch into 5-6 hours, and then 7-8, and eventually right up to 10 or 11 hours once your baby is 9 or 10 months old. Newborn Growth Spurts Believe it or not, A LOT is going on with your newborn baby. So much growth and development is happening in that little body! Your newborn will very likely go through growth spurts at the following times:7-10 days of age2-3 weeks of age4-6 weeks of age3 months of age During these growth spurts, it will feel like your newborn is feeding almost constantly (and like when she’s not feeding, she’s sleeping). This is 100% normal – feed your newborn as often as she needs it, as the extra nourishment is important during the growth spurt. Newborn Feeding and Sleep Schedule Your unique newborn’s wake times and total sleep needs may vary from what is recommended below. These schedules are based on averages, but your baby may need more or less sleep (or shorter/longer wake times) than what is shown below. Remember, watch your baby’s sleepy cues closely (rubbing eyes, yawning, staring off into space, etc. ), and let those guide the sleep schedule. Remember, too, that if your baby is already fussing, he’s already overtired – strive to get him down for his nap earlier next time, before the fussing starts.2-8 Week Old Newborn, Breast Feeding ( This schedule is best for babies who consume average amounts of breast milk, and for moms who have average breast milk production and storage amounts. Babies who eat smaller amounts, babies with reflux, and moms who produce and store smaller amounts of breastmilk would need a different schedule, as would babies who eat larger amounts per feeding, and moms who produce/store greater amounts of breast milk. Schedules for those scenarios, as well as schedules for older breast-fed newborns, are available in our newborn book, Essential Keys To Your Newborn’s Sleep ).9:00 AM – Wake and Feed* 10:00 AM – Nap (30-60 minutes) 11:00 AM – Wake and Feed 12:30 PM – Nap (30-60 minutes) 1:30 PM – Wake and Feed 3:30 PM – Nap (30 – 60 minutes) 4:30 PM – Wake and Feed 6:00 PM – Nap (30 – 60 minutes) 6:30 PM – Wake and Feed 7:30 PM – Catnap (20 – 30 minutes) 8:00 PM – Wake and Feed 9:30 PM – Catnap (20 – 30 minutes) 10:00 PM – Wake and Feed 11:30 PM – Feed and Bedtime* 3:30 AM – Feed and Right back to sleep 6:30 AM – Feed and Right back to sleep* – we recommend you make these fixed points in your baby’s schedule. You can read more about this in our article on fixed points in a baby schedule.2-8 Week Old Newborn, Formula Feeding (You will see that this schedule outlines longer naps and fewer feedings than the breastfeeding schedule above; this is simply because formula is more difficult for baby to digest, so baby tends to feel fuller longer, and therefore needs slightly fewer feedings. For formula-feeding schedules for older newborns, see our newborn book, Essential Keys To Your Newborn’s Sleep)9:00 AM – Wake and Feed* 10:00 AM – Nap (60 – 90 minutes) 11:30 AM – Wake 12:30 PM – Feed and Nap (30 – 60 minutes) 1:30 PM – Wake 3:00 PM – Feed and Nap (60 – 90 minutes) 4:30 PM – Wake and Feed 6:00 PM – Nap (30 – 60 minutes) 6:30 PM – Wake 7:30 PM – Feed and Nap (30 – 60 minutes) 8:30 PM – Wake 9:30 PM – Nap (30 – 60 minutes) 10:00 PM – Wake and Feed 11:30 PM – Feed and Bedtime* 4:30 AM – Feed and Right back to sleep 7:30 AM – Feed and Right back to sleep* – we recommend you make these fixed points in your baby’s schedule.

Well Tempered Clavier The Baroque era was the first period of music to use the ____________ system of tonality almost exclusively. Major-minor The system of music notation where numbers are placed below the bass line to indicate chord tones is called ________________. Figured bass Name the tuning system in which all semitones within the octave are exactly equal in size, allowing music in all keys to sound equally \"in tune\". Equal temperament What are terraced dynamics? When dynamic levels shift abruptly from soft to loud (and back again) without gradual crescendos and decrescendos. Characteristic of Baroque era music and a musical feature that occurred naturally on the harpsichord as it switched between using one or two keyboards at the same time. Describe what \"word painting\" refers to. Word painting is the technique of creating \"pictures\" based on the meaning of the words - emotions, actions, descriptions. This can be done through melodic shape, rhythmic motives and/or harmonies. The music of singers or instrumentalists may contain word painting. What is a ritornello, and what is ritornello form? Ritornello form (Baroque Era) refers to the practice of restating a passage of music (called the ritornello) throughout a movement of music. Ritornello passages are usually \"tutti\" passages - all of the instruments play. Ritornello passages alternate a) in a concerto, with solo or concertino passages; b) in an aria, with sung passages. -ex. Spring Movement I & III from Vivaldi\\'s The Four Seasons Give at least three characteristics of the Baroque Era solo concerto. 1) Popular instrumental genre in which a featured soloist is \"concerted\" against (or set in opposition to) an orchestra (the ripieno). 2) Usually in three movements: fast-slow-fast 3) Movements often use ritornello form, in which a distinctive passage of music is repeated several times throughout. 4) Solo concertos are written specifically to show off the soloist\\'s virtuosity (ability to play flashy, difficult music). What does \"ripieno\" mean? n a Baroque concerto, the large group of instruments that provides the backdrop or \"opposition\" for the more virtuostic soloist (in a solo concerto). Define the term \"concertino\". The small group of soloists in a Baroque concerto that is set against the larger instrumental group, or ripieno/tutti. In a solo concerto, a solo instrument replaces the concertino. Give the term that refers to a rhythmic/melodic pattern that is repeated for an extended period of time, usually as a part of the accompaniment. Ostinato Describe recitative secco. A recitative is a sung narrative that follows the natural flow of language (it is speech-like). \"Secco\" means \"dry\" in Italian - musically, this describes a sparse accompaniment, such as a few chords played by the basso continuo. Often a weak or no perceived metric pulse. What is an oratorio, and how is an oratorio different from an opera? An oratorio is a large-scale, dramatic composition for solo voices and choir. Unlike opera, oratorios do not use costumes or scenery (they are unstaged). Oratorio texts are usually based on religious subjects. What is an opera? Large-scale, dramatic composition for solo voices and choir. Describe recitative accompagnato. How it this different from recitative secco? \"Accompagnato\" means that there is instrumental accompaniment to the vocal soloist - substantially more so than in recitative secco. There is often a stronger metric pulse, as well. What is a \"pedal tone\" or \"drone\"? A low sustained tone played in the lowest (bass) part of a composition while the other parts/voices move above it. What is the word for \"all\" that refers to the performance of a passage of music in which all of the instruments that are present play together. tutti Describe ternary form. A compositional form which consists of 3 sections, an A section (opening material), a B section (contrasting material) and a final A section which restates the opening. What is a prelude (as in \"Prelude and Fugue\")? \"Prelude\" means \\'to come before\\'. J. S. Bach wrote 48 preludes and fugues in two volumes entitled The Well-Tempered Clavier (a clavier being a keyboard instrument). Each prelude has one rhythmic idea as a unifying device. Preludes are often more harmonically-oriented as opposed to the complex counterpoint found in the fugue that follows. Give a description of what a fugue is. Genre of contrapuntal music originating in the Baroque period in which a melodic theme or \"subject\" is introduced by one voice and is then imitated by each of the other voices. The piece then alternates between instances or \"entries\" of the theme and \"episodes\" of counterpoint in which the theme is not present. Give the term for the following: In a fugue, the first thing one hears; it is the melodic theme upon which the fugue is based. It is stated by one of the fugue\\'s 3-6 voices/parts. It is followed by the answer the countersubject (if there is one). Subject Give the term for the following: In a fugue, the second entry of the theme, following the subject. It is in a different voice and implies either dominant harmony or the dominant key. Answer What is the difference between a real answer and a tonal answer, in a fugue? Answers containing the same melodic intervals as the subject are real answers; if altered, the answer is a tonal answer. What is the purpose, in a fugue, of the countersubject and when/where does it appear? In a fugue, the countersubject is a secondary, recurring theme in a fugue. It is heard for the first time at the same time as the answer, in a separate voice. It may be heard against any theme entry after that. Sometimes there are two or more countersubjects in a fugue - or no countersubject. Describe the function played episodes in a fugue. in fugues, an episode is a passage between entries of the theme (subject or answer) that is an area of relaxation. Episodes do not contain any theme entries. Fugues generally alternate between subject entry sections and episodes. What is the word used to describe a situation in a fugue where two entries of the theme (subject or answer) overlap one another? Hint: This often occurs near the end of a fugue. Stretto What is a homorhythmic texture? A musical texture where all the parts sing with the same rhythm at the same time, though not necessarily the same notes. Example: opening of the \"Hallelujah\" chorus from Handel\\'s Messiah. Give the term for when a single word or syllable is sung over a series of notes. Often a part of word painting, to give emphasis and importance to certain words. melisma Describe the form and musical characteristics of a typical Baroque era French Overture. A French overture, often used as an introductory movement to an oratorio, opera or suite, is in AB (binary) form: A is slow and stately/regal with dotted rhythms; B is lively and contrapuntal (often fugal). A may be repeated, creating a ternary (ABA) form. Explain rounded binary form. A version of binary form in which second section contains contrasting material (B) as well as a repetition or reprise of the A section. ||: A :|| ||: B A :||Describe the term for when, at the end of a piece in the minor mode, the 3rd of the tonic chord is raised to create a major tonic chord. The idea is to give the ending a greater sense of finality. J. S. Bach used this technique frequently. Tierce de Picardie or \"Picardy 3rd\".

       "        {'text': 'Computer hardware Computer hardware From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Personal computer hardware)navigation search PDP-11 CPU board Computer hardware are the physical parts or components of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card, sound card and motherboard. [1] By contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and ran by hardware. Hardware is directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system. Contents [ hide ]1 Von Neumann architecture2 Sales3 Different systems3.1 Personal computer3.1.1 Case3.1.2 Power supply3.1.3 Motherboard3.1.4 Expansion cards3.1.5 Storage devices3.1.5.1 Fixed media3.1.5.2 Removable media3.1.6 Input and output peripherals3.1.6.1 Input3.1.6.2 Output device3.2 Mainframe computer3.3 Departmental computing3.4 Supercomputer4 Hardware upgrade5 Recycling5.1 Toxic computer components5.2 Environmental effects5.3 National services6 See also7 Sources8 External links Von Neumann architecture [ edit]Main article: Von Neumann architecture Von Neumann architecture scheme The template for all modern computers is the Von Neumann architecture, detailed in a 1945 paper by Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann. This describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with subdivisions of a processing unit consisting of an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers, a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter, a memory to store both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms. [2] The meaning of the term has evolved to mean a stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus. This is referred to as the Von Neumann bottleneck and often limits the performance of the system. [3]Sales [ edit]For the third consecutive year, U. S. business-to-business channel sales (sales through distributors and commercial resellers) increased, ending 2013 up nearly 6 percent at $61.7 billion. The impressive growth was the fastest sales increase since the end of the recession. Sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year peaking in fourth quarter with a 6.9 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2012. [4]Different systems [ edit]There are a number of different types of computer system in use today. Personal computer [ edit]Basic hardware components of a modern personal computer, including a monitor, a motherboard, a CPU, a RAM, two expansion cards, a power supply, an optical disc drive, a hard disk drive, a keyboard and a mouse Inside a custom-built computer: power supply at the bottom has its own cooling fan The personal computer, also known as the PC, is one of the most common types of computer due to its versatility and relatively low price. Laptops are generally very similar, although they may use lower-power or reduced size components, thus lower performance. Case [ edit]Main article: Computer case The computer case encloses most of the components of the system. It provides mechanical support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies, and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components. The case is also part of the system to control electromagnetic interference radiated by the computer, and protects internal parts from electrostatic discharge. Large tower cases provide extra internal space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals and usually stand on the floor, while desktop cases provide less expansion room. All-in-one style designs from Apple, namely the i Mac, and similar types, include a video display built into the same case. Portable and laptop computers require cases that provide impact protection for the unit. A current development in laptop computers is a detachable keyboard, which allows the system to be configured as a touch-screen tablet. Hobbyists may decorate the cases with colored lights, paint, or other features, in an activity called case modding. Power supply [ edit]Main article: Power supply unit (computer)A power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage DC power for the internal components of the computer. Laptops are capable of running from a built-in battery, normally for a period of hours. [5]Motherboard [ edit]Main article: Motherboard The motherboard is the main component of a computer. It is a board with integrated circuitry that connects the other parts of the computer including the CPU, the RAM, the disk drives ( CD, DVD, hard disk, or any others) as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the expansion slots. Components directly attached to or to part of the motherboard include: The CPU (central processing unit), which performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function, and is sometimes referred to as the brain of the computer. It is usually cooled by a heatsink and fan, or water-cooling system. Most newer CPUs include an on-die Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The clock speed of CPUs governs how fast it executes instructions, and is measured in GHz; typical values lie between 1 GHz and 5 GHz. Many modern computers have the option to overclock the CPU which enhances performance at the expense of greater thermal output and thus a need for improved cooling. The chipset, which includes the north bridge, mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory. Random-access memory (RAM), which stores the code and data that are being actively accessed by the CPU. For example, when a web browser is opened on the computer it takes up memory; this is stored in the RAM until the web browser is closed. RAM usually comes on DIMMs in the sizes 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB, but can be much larger. Read-only memory (ROM), which stores the BIOS that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution, a process known as Bootstrapping, or \" booting \" or \"booting up\". The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) includes boot firmware and power management firmware. Newer motherboards use Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) instead of BIOS. Buses that connect the CPU to various internal components and to expand cards for graphics and sound. The CMOS battery, which powers the memory for date and time in the BIOS chip. This battery is generally a watch battery. The video card (also known as the graphics card), which processes computer graphics. More powerful graphics cards are better suited to handle strenuous tasks, such as playing intensive video games. Expansion cards [ edit]Main article: Expansion card An expansion card in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. Expansions cards can be used to obtain or expand on features not offered by the motherboard. Storage devices [ edit]Main article: Computer data storage A storage device is any computing hardware and digital media that is used for storing, porting and extracting data files and objects. It can hold and store information both temporarily and permanently, and can be internal or external to a computer, server or any similar computing device. Data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers. Fixed media [ edit]Data is stored by a computer using a variety of media. Hard disk drives are found in virtually all older computers, due to their high capacity and low cost, but solid-state drives are faster and more power efficient, although currently more expensive than hard drives in terms of dollar per gigabyte, [6] so are often found in personal computers built post-2007. [7] Some systems may use a disk array controller for greater performance or reliability. Removable media [ edit]To transfer data between computers, a USB flash drive or optical disc may be used. Their usefulness depends on being readable by other systems; the majority of machines have an optical disk drive, and virtually all have at least one USB port. Input and output peripherals [ edit]Main article: Peripheral Input and output devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis. The following are either standard or very common to many computer systems. Input [ edit]Input devices allow the user to enter information into the system, or control its operation. Most personal computers have a mouse and keyboard, but laptop systems typically use a touchpad instead of a mouse. Other input devices include webcams, microphones, joysticks, and image scanners. Output device [ edit]Output devices display information in a human readable form. Such devices could include printers, speakers, monitors or a Braille embosser. Mainframe computer [ edit]Main article: Mainframe Computer A mainframe computer is a much larger computer that typically fills a room and may cost many hundreds or thousands of times as much as a personal computer. They are designed to perform large numbers of calculations for governments and large enterprises. An IBM System z9 mainframe Departmental computing [ edit]Main article: Minicomputer In the 1960s and 1970s, more and more departments started to use cheaper and dedicated systems for specific purposes like process control and laboratory automation. Supercomputer [ edit]Main article: Supercomputer A supercomputer is superficially similar to a mainframe, but is instead intended for extremely demanding computational tasks. As of June 2016, the fastest supercomputer in the world is the Sunway Taihu Light, in Jiangsu, China. [8]The term supercomputer does not refer to a specific technology. Rather it indicates the fastest computations available at any given time. In mid 2011, the fastest supercomputers boasted speeds exceeding one petaflop, or 1 quadrillion (10^15 or 1,000 trillion) floating point operations per second. Super computers are fast but extremely costly so they are generally used by large organizations to execute computationally demanding tasks involving large data sets. Super computers typically run military and scientific applications. Although they cost millions of dollars, they are also being used for commercial applications where huge amounts of data must be analyzed. For example, large banks employ supercomputers to calculate the risks and returns of various investment strategies, and healthcare organizations use them to analyze giant databases of patient data to determine optimal treatments for various diseases and problems incurring to the country. Hardware upgrade [ edit]When using computer hardware, an upgrade means adding new hardware to a computer that improves its performance, adds capacity or new features. For example, a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the hard drive with a SSD to get a boost in performance or increase the amount of files that may be stored. Also, the user could increase the RAM so the computer may run more smoothly. The user could add a USB 3.0 expansion card in order to fully use USB 3.0 devices, or could upgrade the GPU for extra rendering power. Performing such hardware upgrades may be necessary for older computers to meet a programs\\' system requirements. Recycling [ edit]Because computer parts contain hazardous materials, there is a growing movement to recycle old and outdated parts. [9] Computer hardware contain dangerous chemicals such as: lead, mercury, nickel, and cadmium. According to the EPA these e-wastes have a harmful effect on the environment unless they are disposed of properly. Making hardware requires energy, and recycling parts will reduce air pollution, water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. [10] Disposing unauthorized computer equipment is in fact illegal. Legislation makes it mandatory to recycle computers through the government approved facilities. Recycling a computer can be made easier by taking out certain reusable parts. For example, the RAM, DVD drive, the graphics card, hard drive or SSD, and other similar removable parts can be reused. Toxic computer components [ edit]The central processing unit contains many toxic materials. It contains lead and chromium in the metal plates. Resistors, semi-conductors, infrared detectors, stabilizers, cables, and wires contain cadmium. The circuit boards in a computer contain mercury, and chromium. [11] When these types of materials, and chemicals are disposed improperly will become hazardous for the environment. Environmental effects [ edit]According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency only around 15% of the e-waste actually is recycled. When e-waste byproducts leach into ground water are burned or get mishandled during recycling it causes harm. Health problems associated with such toxins include impaired mental development, cancer, and damage to the lungs, liver, and kidneys. [12] That\\'s why even wires have to be recycled. Different companies have different techniques to recycle a wire. The most popular one is the grinder that separates the copper wires form the plastic/rubber casing. When the processes is done there are two different piles left; one containing the copper powder, and the other containing plastic/rubber pieces. [13] Computer monitors, mice, and keyboards all have a similar way of being recycled. For example, first each of the parts are taken apart then all of the inner parts get separated and placed into its own bin. [14]National services [ edit]Recycling a computer is made easier by a few of the national services, such as Dell and Apple. Both companies will take back the computer of their make or any other make. Otherwise a computer can be donated to Computer Aid International which is an organization that recycles and refurbishes old computers for hospitals, schools, universities, etc. [15]See also [ edit]Information technology portal Computer architecture Electronic hardware Glossary of computer hardware terms History of computing hardware List of computer hardware manufacturers Open-source computing hardware Sources [ edit]^ \"Parts of computer\".

       "        {'text': \"Top 10 Most Influential Scientists Humans Top 10 Most Influential Scientists Mongoose February 24, 2009Share 898 Stumble 10K Tweet Pin 124 +1 17 Share 2011KThis is part one of what will be a two part series on the most influential scientists in history. While these are not technically the “greatest” scientists, there is bound to be some overlap as the contributions that many of these men and women made to science are among the most important. Be sure to tell us who you think should be on the future list – we already have our second ten, but it might lead to a third or fourth.10Marie Curie1867 – 1934“One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done.”Polish physicist and chemist, Marie Curie was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity, the only person honored with Nobel Prizes in two different sciences, and the first female professor at the University of Paris. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw. Her husband Pierre Curie was also a Nobel laureate, as were her daughter Irene Joliot-Curie and son-in-law Frederic Joliot-Curie. Her achievements include the creation of a theory of radioactivity (a term coined by her), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two new elements, radium and polonium. It was also under her personal direction that the world’s first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms (“cancers”), using radioactive isotopes. While an actively loyal French citizen, she never lost her sense of Polish identity. She named the first new chemical element that she discovered (1898) “polonium” for her native country, and in 1932 she founded a Radium Institute in her hometown Warsaw, headed by her physician-sister Bronis?awa.9Alan Turing1912 – 1954“Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition.”English mathematician and logician, Turing is often considered to be the father of modern computer science. He provided an influential formalization of the concept of the algorithm and computation with the Turing machine. With the Turing test, meanwhile, he made a significant and characteristically provocative contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence: whether it will ever be possible to say that a machine is conscious and can think. He later worked at the National Physical Laboratory, creating one of the first designs for a stored-program computer, the ACE, although it was never actually built in its full form. In 1948, he moved to the University of Manchester to work on the Manchester Mark I, then emerging as one of the world’s earliest true computers. During the Second World War, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, the UK’s code breaking centre, and was for a time head of Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the bombe, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.8Niels Bohr1885 – 1962“An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field.”Niels Bohr was a Danish physicist who made fundamental contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum mechanics, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. Bohr’s work helped solve the problems classical physics could not explain about the nuclear model of the atom. He postulated that electrons moved in fixed orbits around the atom’s nucleus, and he explained how they emitted or absorbed energy. Bohr mentored and collaborated with many of the top physicists of the century at his institute in Copenhagen. He was also part of the team of physicists working on the Manhattan Project. One of his sons, Aage Niels Bohr, grew up to be an important physicist who, like his father, received the Nobel Prize, in 1975. Bohr has been described as one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century.7Max Planck1858 – 1947“We have no right to assume that any physical laws exist, or if they have existed up to now, that they will continue to exist in a similar manner in the future.”Max Planck, a German physicist, is considered to be the founder of quantum theory, and one of the most important physicists of the twentieth century. Planck made many contributions to theoretical physics, but his fame rests primarily on his role as originator of the quantum theory. This theory revolutionized our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes, just as Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space and time. Together they constitute the fundamental theories of 20th-century physics. His discoveries have led to industrial and military applications that affect every aspect of modern life.6Charles Darwin1809 – 1882“I love fools’ experiments. I am always making them.”English naturalist and biologist, Darwin demonstrated that all species of life have evolved over time from common ancestors through the process he called natural selection. The fact that evolution occurs became accepted by the scientific community and the general public in his lifetime, while his theory of natural selection came to be widely seen as the primary explanation of the process of evolution in the 1930s, and now forms the basis of modern evolutionary theory. In modified form, Darwin’s scientific discovery remains the foundation of biology, as it provides a unifying logical explanation for the diversity of life. His 1859 book On the Origin of Species established evolution by common descent as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. He also examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. In recognition of Darwin’s pre-eminence, he was one of only five 19th century UK non-royal personages to be honored by a state funeral.5Leonardo da Vinci1452 – 1519“Anyone who conducts an argument by appealing to authority is not using his intelligence; he is just using his memory.”Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian polymath. He was an expert mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, painter, sculptor, architect, botanist, musician and writer. Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the “Renaissance man”, a man whose seemingly infinite curiosity was equalled only by his powers of invention. Leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity. He conceptualized a helicopter, a tank, concentrated solar power, a calculator, the double hull and outlined a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, but some of his smaller inventions, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As a scientist, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of anatomy, civil engineering, optics, and hydrodynamics.4Galileo Galilei1564 – 1642“All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.”Galileo was an Italian physicist and astronomer. His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations, and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the “father of modern observational astronomy”, the “father of modern physics”, the “father of science”, and “the Father of Modern Science.” The motion of uniformly accelerated objects, taught in nearly all high school and introductory college physics courses, was studied by Galileo as the subject of kinematics. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, named the Galilean moons in his honor, and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, improving compass design. Galileo’s championing of Copernicanism was controversial within his lifetime. The geocentric view had been dominant since the time of Aristotle, and the controversy engendered by Galileo’s presentation of heliocentrism as proven fact resulted in the Catholic Church’s prohibiting its advocacy because it was not empirically proven at the time. Galileo was eventually forced to recant his heliocentrism and spent the last years of his life under house arrest on orders of the Holy Inquisition.3Nikola Tesla1856 – 1943“The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.”Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as the most important scientist and inventor of the modern age, a man who “shed light over the face of Earth”. He is best known for many revolutionary contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Tesla’s patents and theoretical work formed the basis of modern alternating current electric power (AC) systems, including the polyphase power distribution systems and the AC motor, with which he helped usher in the Second Industrial Revolution. Contemporary biographers of Tesla have regarded him as “The Father of Physics”, “The man who invented the twentieth century” and “the patron saint of modern electricity.” Aside from his work on electromagnetism and electromechanical engineering, Tesla has contributed in varying degrees to the establishment of robotics, remote control, radar and computer science, and to the expansion of ballistics, nuclear physics, and theoretical physics. In 1943, the Supreme Court of the United States credited him as being the inventor of the radio. Many of his achievements have been used, with some controversy, to support various pseudosciences, UFO theories, and early New Age occultism.2Albert Einstein1879 – 1955“A man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be.”Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. Einstein’s many contributions to physics include his special theory of relativity, which reconciled mechanics with electromagnetism, and his general theory of relativity, which was intended to extend the principle of relativity to non-uniform motion and to provide a new theory of gravitation. His other contributions include advances in the fields of relativistic cosmology, capillary action, critical opalescence, classical problems of statistical mechanics and their application to quantum theory, an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules, atomic transition probabilities, the quantum theory of a monatomic gas, thermal properties of light with low radiation density (which laid the foundation for the photon theory), a theory of radiation including stimulated emission, the conception of a unified field theory, and the geometrization of physics. Einstein published over 300 scientific works and over 150 non-scientific works. The physics community reveres Einstein, and in 1999 Time magazine named him the “Person of the Century”. In wider culture the name “Einstein” has become synonymous with genius.1Isaac Newton1643 – 1727“To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.”Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the most influential men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the history of science. In this work, Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, laying the groundwork for classical mechanics, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries and is the basis for modern engineering. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler’s laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation, thus removing the last doubts about heliocentrism and advancing the scientific revolution. In mechanics, Newton enunciated the principles of conservation of momentum and angular momentum. In optics, he built the first “practical” reflecting telescope and developed a theory of color based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into a visible spectrum. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound. In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus. He also demonstrated the generalized binomial theorem, developed the so-called “Newton’s method” for approximating the zeroes of a function, and contributed to the study of power series. Newton’s stature among scientists remains at the very top rank, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists in Britain’s Royal Society asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton was deemed much more influential than Albert Einstein.

Unfortunately, if a game is being touted as a bizarre tale I need to know a bit about the plot. In Sally Face, outside of the main character having a “prosthetic face” there’s little that we know. What exactly is a prosthetic face, anyway? It’s not mentioned beyond a short “That’s a story for another day” blurb at the bottom. Based on what little I know about Sally Face, I like the idea but the pitch is a bit too anemic for my tastes. An adventure game, at its core, is the story and puzzles. Neither are adequately discussed in either the text nor video. The first episode is available for free, though. When A Demo Isn’t Enough Is there enough there to download and try out Sally Face? It’s certainly piqued my interest. Will I try out the demo? Probably, just to get a better understanding of the story. However, not everybody is going to play it. It’s important for developers crowdfunding a project to realize that while a demo is great, people need to have their interest piqued if they’re going to bother clicking that download button. For this reason, having something concrete in text or video about the plot is needed. Just a paragraph or two more in the case of Sally Face would help a lot. The biggest issue I have with Sally Face, though, is it’s funding scheme. I hate Indie Gogo’s “flexible funding” option. No matter how well or poorly a project does, it still gets whatever’s pledged. At least with this one, we sort of know what will happen if it doesn’t get every penny asked for. It just means fewer episodes will be released.

Serena Nelson • 1 year ago I don\\'t use Indie Gogo for a variety of reasons, but the biggest one is regarding their \"flexible funding\" option. I don\\'t like seeing projects that go this route because they\\'ll get the money regardless of if they \"fund\" or not. I really do find Sally Face intriguing, but even if I do like what\\'s there so far I won\\'t be backing it on principle. I might pick it up when it releases, though.

I received my Federal refund on the 15th, but I\\'m still waiting on my State refune. According to GA Dept. of Revenue..it states that my refund is being reviewed. When I called I waited on the phone close to 1 hour just for someone to tell me that when it\\'s being \\'reviewed\\' it is actually being processed. They are extremely slow this year. I do know that in Jaunary 2012 the state of GA accidentally put too much money in thousands of peoples\\' accounts. They had to go right back in and take it and re-deposit it. They are sooo slow.

I *finally* received my NC tax refund May 8 after filing in early April. I have yet to receive the Georgia refund. I know in Tennessee that if they owe you money, they don\\'t give it back to you. My friend was owed nearly $100 and never received it after filing in January. So, you essentially pay them more just out of the goodness of your heart. It\\'s a crock. I hope Georgia isn\\'t like that. Was this comment helpful? Yes | Nohutchens.rita said: I am also waiting on my NC refund check. I filed electronically at a tax office on March 9th. I can\\'t find a date for it to be direct deposited. My federal came in 2 weeks. I can\\'t even get a projected date for my direct deposit. I have even contacted my bank to see if they had any information. After calling one of the government numbers they stated that they were unable to process my direct deposit request. And that a paper check would be mailed as quickly as possible. This is Bull because my federal was direct deposited, so what is the problem. This has been about 2 weeks ago. Was this comment helpful?

Yes | No 100% Helpful Someone said: Remember that most states are running large deficits, and even though you are owed a refund, they will take longer to send it, if they do not have the funds available. Also, a lot of states run refunds out in batches, such as all refunds received and processed by Feb 15th, get sent out March 191st. This isn`t exact and all states are different, so you need to check with your specific state for more precise information. Perhaps instead of waiting for large refunds, and budgeting or placing all hope on getting a timely refund, you should adjust your W4, to only be taking out just enough taxes to cover your state and federal tax liability. By getting a large refund every year, your are only giving the government an interest free loan, and wouldn`t it be better to have that extra money to use now? Was this comment helpful?

Finally after multiple attempts to speak to a real person she had to act like she owed them money to get a human. At that time they stated that it will take a total of 11 weeks to get taxes back because of our filing status. Done by preparers at that, whom had no idea of the new 11 week rule. I wonder, will they attatch interest to that. Because if not, as they earn interest on it, they will continue to do this to multiple people with no incentive to do these things in a timely manner. IRS are crooks and frauds. If I took 11 weeks to pay them after a notice to pay, my license would be suspended and I would possibly face jail time. FN CROOKS!!!!!! Founding fathers would be ashamed.

However, there is a severe lack of diversity among this year\\'s litany of hopeful winners. Only white actors have been nominated in the four acting categories, and all of the Best Director candidates are males. Last year, the Academy was accused of lacking diversity in its slate of Oscar nominees - with the hashtag #Oscars So White trending on social media - and within minutes of the nominations being revealed on Thursday morning, it happened again on Twitter.

The Supporting Actor nominees are Christian Bale (The Big Short), Tom Hardy (The Revenant), Mark Ruffalo (Spotlight), Mark Rylance (Bridge Of Spies) and Sylvester Stallone (Creed). And the Supporting Actress nominees are Jennifer Lason Leigh (The Hateful Eight), Rooney Mara (Carol), Rachel Mc Adams (Spotlight), Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl) and Kate Winslet (Steve Jobs). Following The Revenant\\'s impressive 12 nods, Mad Max: Fury Road is in second place with 10 nominations, The Martian with seven and Bridge Of Spies with six, although director Steven Spielberg was missed off the Best Director list for his Cold War drama. Redmayne will certainly be hoping to follow his 2015 Oscars success: the 34-year-old lost out on the Golden Globe in the leading actor category to his rival Di Caprio at Sunday\\'s ceremony.

In a fight for survival, Glass treks through snow-covered forests, gets swept away in a waterfall, sleeps inside the carcass of a disemboweled horse and hungrily eats raw bison liver before making it back to his camp. Ridley Scott\\'s The Martian is a sci-fi extravaganza, and has scored seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor. When astronauts take off from Mars, they leave behind Mark Watney, played by Matt Damon, who is presumed dead after a fierce storm. With only a scant amount of supplies, the stranded visitor must utilise his wits and spirit to find a way to survive on the hostile planet.

Adam Mc Kay\\'s The Big Short is another hot contender for a slew of gongs at this year\\'s ceremony with its all-star cast, including Christian Bale, Steve Carrell, Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling. The movie focuses on four outsiders who can tell that there is going to be a global economy collapse and create a new plan called The Big Short. Their bold investment leads them into the seedy world of modern banking where they must question everyone and everything to protect themselves.+39Announcement: Actor John Krasinski and Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs dictated the nominations on Thursday morning+39Shock in Hollywood: Many have been left angered that all of the five Best Director nominees are males, and that the acting categories only include white actors Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne star in \\'The Danish Girl\\'Loaded Progress 0:00/0:00Spotlight, directed by Tom Mc Carthy, is based on the true story of The Boston Globe\\'s editor Marty Baron who, in 2001, assigns a team of journalists to investigate a priest accused of molesting over 80 boys. The reporters - including Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Matt Carroll (Brian d\\'Arcy James) and Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel Mc Adams) - make it their mission to provide proof of a cover-up of sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church. In Room - based on Emma Donoghue\\'s novel of the same name - Brie Larson plays Ma, a woman living in captivity with her young son who was fathered by her captor. She then manages to escape and explain the reality of the world to her five-year-old son Jack, as he must come face-to-face with the world for the first time in his life. Mad Max: Fury Road - the fourth installment in the popular franchise - is a post-apocalyptic, all-action film that shows the collapse of civilisation while a few fight to survive in a desert wasteland.+39Acclaim: Eddie\\'s performance in The Danish Girl may score him his second Oscar+39Bringing him to life: Michael impressed as Steve Jobs in Danny Boyle\\'s biographical big screen effort+39She could win again: Best Actress nominee Jennifer portrays self-made millionaire and divorced single mother Joy Mangano in David O.

Set in 1950s New York, Brooklyn centres on Irish immigrant Eilis Lacey, played by Saoirse Ronan, and her illicit romance with a tough Italian plumber. However, she faces temptation from another man when she returns to Ireland. Steven Spielberg\\'s Bridge Of Spies is a Cold War drama starring Tom Hanks and Supporting Actor nominee Mark Rylance. The historical thriller is based on the Soviet Union\\'s capture of US pilot Francis Gary Powers, and the fight to get him out of prison. His hopes rest on lawyer James Donovan (Hanks) who is recruited by a CIA operative. The documentary about Amy Winehouse, called Amy, is nominated for Best Documentary Feature, as is What Happened, Miss Simone? about singer Nina Simone, The Look Of Silence, Cartel Land and Winter On Fire: Ukraine\\'s Fight For Freedom.+39Here they come: Chris Rock is set to present the 88th Academy Awards ceremony on February 28, live from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California British author Alex Garland was honoured for his original screenplay for Ex Machina. Also competing in the best original screenplay category are Bridge Of Spies, Inside Out, Spotlight and Straight Outta Compton. British author Nick Hornby received a nominated in the Adapted Screenplay category for Brooklyn, while Irish author Emma Donoghue got a nod for her adaptation of her own novel Room. They will compete against Drew Goddard for his adaptation of Alex Weir\\'s novel The Martian, Phyllis Nagy for Carol, which is based on the Patricia Highsmith novel The Price Of Salt, and Charles Randolph and Adam Mc Kay for The Big Short, which is based on Michael Lewis\\'s book of the same name. In terms of those who have been left off the list of nominations this year, Ridley Scott is perhaps the most shocking of all. The Martian director was overlooked, as was Carol director Todd Haynes. Many thought Michael Keaton, a best actor nominee last year for Birdman who was defeated by Redmayne, might score a nomination this year for Spotlight, but he was also snubbed. In the Best Picture category, many expected the critically acclaimed Carol to get a nod, but it was notably missed. The star-studded ceremony - the biggest of the entire annual awards season - will be held on February 28. It will be hosted by comic actor Chris Rock and will take place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California.

The combination of fusidic acid and Atorvastatin Tablets can lead to serious muscle problems (rhabdomyolysis).if you have had a previous stroke with bleeding into the brain, or have small pockets of fluid in the brain from previous strokeif you have kidney problemsif you have an under-active thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)if you have had repeated or unexplained muscle aches or pains, a personal history or family history of muscle problemsif you have had previous muscular problems during treatment with other lipid-lowering medicines (e.g. other ‘statin’ or ‘fibrate’ medicines)if you regularly drink a large amount of alcoholif you have a history of liver diseaseif you are older than 70 years If any of these apply to you, your doctor will need to carry out a blood test before and possibly during your treatment with Atorvastatin Tablets to predict your risk of muscle related side effects. The risk of muscle related side effects e.g. rhabdomyolysis is known to increase when certain medicines are taken at the same time (see section 2 “Other medicines and Atorvastatin Tablets”). Contact your doctor immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. This is because on rare occasions, muscle problems can be serious, including muscle breakdown, resulting in kidney damage, and very rare deaths have occurred. Also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have a muscle weakness that is constant. Additional tests and medicines may be needed to diagnose and treat this. While you are on this medicine your doctor will monitor you closely if you have diabetes or are at risk of developing diabetes. You are likely to be at risk of developing diabetes if you have high levels of sugars and fats in your blood, are overweight and have high blood pressure. Other medicines and Atorvastatin Tablets Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. There are some medicines that may change the effect of Atorvastatin Tablets or their effect may be changed by Atorvastatin Tablets. This type of interaction could make one or both of the medicines less effective. Alternatively it could increase the risk or severity of side-effects, including the important muscle wasting condition known as rhabdomyolysis described in section 4: Medicines used to alter the way your immune system works e.g. ciclosporin Certain antibiotics or antifungal medicines e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, rifampin, fusidic acid. Other medicines to regulate lipid levels e.g. gemfibrozil, other fibrates, colestipol Some calcium channel blockers used for angina or high blood pressure, e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem; medicines to regulate your heart rhythm e.g. digoxin, verapamil, amiodarone Medicines used in the treatment of HIV e.g. ritonavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, indinavir, darunavir, the combination of tipranavir/ritonavir etc. Some medicines used in the treatment of hepatitis C e.g. telaprevir Other medicines known to interact with Atorvastatin Tablets include ezetimibe (lowers cholesterol), warfarin (which reduces blood clotting), oral contraceptives, stiripentol (an anti-convulsant for epilepsy), cimetidine (used for heartburn and peptic ulcers), phenazone (a painkiller), colchicine (used to treat gout), antacids (indigestion products containing aluminium or magnesium) and boceprevir (used to treat liver disease such as hepatitis C)Medicines obtained without a prescription: St John’s Wort If you need to take oral fusidic acid to treat a bacterial infection you will need to temporarily stop using this medicine. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to restart Atorvastatin Tablets. Taking Atorvastatin Tablets with fusidic acid may rarely lead to muscle weakness, tenderness of pain (rhabdomyolysis). See more information regarding rhabdomyolysis in section 4. Atorvastatin Tablets with food and drink See Section 3 for instructions on how to take Atorvastatin Tablets. Please note the following: Grapefruit juice Do not take more than one or two small glasses of grapefruit juice per day because large quantities of grapefruit juice can change the effects of Atorvastatin Tablets. Alcohol Avoid drinking too much alcohol while taking this medicine. See Section 2 “Warnings and precautions” for details. Pregnancy and Breast-feeding Do not take Atorvastatin Tablets if you are pregnant, or if you are trying to become pregnant. Do not take Atorvastatin Tablets if you are able to become pregnant unless you use reliable contraceptive measures. Do not take Atorvastatin Tablets if you are breast-feeding. The safety of Atorvastatin Tablets during pregnancy and breast-feeding has not yet been proven. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. Driving and using machines Normally this medicine does not affect your ability to drive or operate machines. However, do not drive if this medicine affects your ability to drive. Do not use any tools or machines if your ability to use them is affected by this medicine. Atorvastatin Tablets contain lactose If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.3. HOW TO TAKE ATORVASTATIN TABLETSBefore starting treatment, your doctor will place you on a low-cholesterol diet, which you should maintain also during therapy with Atorvastatin Tablets. The usual starting dose of Atorvastatin Tablets is 10 mg once a day in adults and children aged 10 years or older. This may be increased if necessary by your doctor until you are taking the amount you need. Your doctor will adapt the dose at intervals of 4 weeks or more. The maximum dose of Atorvastatin Tablets is 80 mg once a day. Atorvastatin Tablets should be swallowed whole with a drink of water, and can be taken at any time of day, with or without food. However, try to take your tablet at the same time every day. Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The duration of treatment with Atorvastatin Tablets is determined by your doctor. Please ask your doctor if you think that the effect of Atorvastatin Tablets is too strong or too weak. If you take more Atorvastatin Tablets than you should If you accidently take too many Atorvastatin Tablets (more than your usual daily dose) contact your doctor or nearest hospital for advice. If you forget to take Atorvastatin Tablets If you forget to take a dose, just take your next scheduled dose at the correct time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop taking Atorvastatin Tablets If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine or wish to stop your treatment, ask your doctor or pharmacist.4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTSLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. If you experience any of the following serious side effects, stop taking your tablets and tell your doctor immediately or go to the nearest hospital accident and emergency department. Rare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 peopleserious allergic reaction which causes swelling of the face, tongue and throat that can cause great difficulty in breathing.serious illness with severe peeling and swelling of the skin, blistering of the skin, mouth, eyes, genitals and fever.

For me, it is chicken liver, live shad or my favorite recipe: cherry chicken – raw chicken marinated and refrigerated for several days in cherry Kool-Aid. Dough balls of every variety are always popular with anglers, and one woman even tells me that spitting on night crawlers is her go-to bait of choice. While none of these baits are breaking news, we like them because they work. On occasion, we run out of the tried-and-true favorites and must resort to whatever is available. Experimenting with items we can throw on the hook just out of curiosity is also part of the fun. I’ve run into anglers who have turned to all kinds of odd items on a whim for bait like KFC’s potato wedges, cooked turkey tails, freezer-burned salmon roe chunks, Starburst, moldy Swiss cheese, chicken drumsticks, scented candles, Big John’s baked beans, stale blueberry glazed doughnuts, Slim Jim’s, goldfish and jelly beans. Some folks even use opossum, though I am still trying to figure out how this one goes on the hook. Though the most common catfish – channel, blue and flathead catfish – have varied preferences in their natural diets, they are all opportunistic feeders. This means that if bait is enticing enough, they will not discriminate. Sometimes you just get lucky with the experimental items, but we found 10 secret (and proven) catfish baits you didn’t know about that have the staying power to attract catfish time after time.1. Cow’s Blood It turns out that hefty blue catfish are wildly attracted to cows blood. This secret bait comes to me from a small corner of Arkansas and has proven to pull in large blue catfish averaging 35 pounds from the Sulphur River. This requires taking a 2.5 gallon bucket to the butcher (or slaughterhouse if there is one in your area) to fill with cow’s blood. Once it settles, the blood coagulates into a gelatinous-type consistency. Working well in rivers, lakes and ponds, this bait proves most successful for night fishing by the bank. In the daytime, brim will quickly eat your bait. To use: Grab small chunks (about 1-inch thick), and put into light netting or pantyhose to hold it together. Secure at the top with a knot or twist-tie. Thread onto your hook.2. Green Apple Bubble Gum Green apple bubble gum has a strong flavor that instantly appeals to catfish. Channel catfish, with their evolved sense of smell are the prime catch. Since most gums come pre-packaged, it is convenient bait that is easy to use and transport. It’s also not as smelly or as messy as stink bait. Beyond its ability to attract large catfish, bubble gum is preferred by the anglers who use it because it firmly stays on the hook. Gum even helps the catfish stick to the hook as it tries to swallow the bait. Green apple flavor works well, but catfish also like other fruit flavors like strawberry and grape. Some anglers swear by Bazooka gum, but we all know that flavor doesn’t last very long. I recommend sticking to Bubbalicious or another juicy-flavored bubble gum. To use: Chew the gum for a few minutes first. This helps to release the flavors, making it easier to manipulate and stick to the hook. Both treble hooks and circle hooks work great with bubble gum.3. Spoiled Shrimp When that bag of cocktail shrimp goes bad in your fridge, don’t let it go to waste. There are plenty of blue, channel and flathead catfish that would enjoy it. Spoiled shrimp is a delightful choice in the underwater buffet. Many grocery stores are happy to part with their spoiled shrimp if you ask (tell them it is for bait). You can flash freeze it in gallon-sized bags to keep it for your next fishing trip. Some anglers prefer to let the shrimp bask in the sun for five days in order to gain extra scent. True, it’s a smelly endeavor, but it works. I recommend hauling your bait in several tightly sealed bags. To use: Spoiled shrimp can be used thawed or frozen. Run your hook from the head of the shrimp out through the tail leaving the tip exposed. New Posts on Catfish Baits (Updated 2017)Don’t Be Afraid to Experiment with Catfish Baits Catfish Bait Recipe: WD-40 Marinated Chicken What’s the Big Stink About Catfish Baits? Is There Anything A Catfish Won’t Eat?4. French Fries Why wouldn’t catfish love French fries? They’re delicious. The French fry bait was likely devised from the “all I have is my lunch’ moment”, but anglers swear by it. Fries work wonders for attracting channel and flathead catfish. The added grease and that intoxicating scent can motivate even the most lethargic catfish out of the holes. Fries have a broad appeal so beware of pan fish that will also pick at the bait. Keep in mind that many waterfront restaurants could be prime fishing spots. In fact, anglers who prefer this bait often say their best catches are near waterfront fast food restaurants where the fish are conditioned to hunt for fries. To use: Pick up fries on the way to your fishing spot. Warm fries enable the grease to get into the water faster and create a scent trail. Hook fries from the center and thread like a worm. Bury the point of the hook near the end.5. Canned Dog Food Canned dog food is used in several ways to attract catfish. This bait works best for channel catfish, which have taste buds distributed throughout their bodies that provide their keen sense of smell. Chunk dog food like Alpo Prime Cuts comes in meaty squares with added flavors of cheese, bacon and gravy. The chunk meat is easy to use and the cats love them! Non-chunk dog food requires a little more work but it is also successful in attracting fish. This requires using an onion bag or cheesecloth to secure the food, yet allows it to leak out through the holes once it is in the water. To use: Chunk dog food is easy and portable. Simply thread bite-size pieces onto the hook. Some anglers use dog food for chum. You can drop punctured dog food cans near your fishing spot before you throw out your line, or even sink cans the day before to attract fish to the area. The best chum dog food varieties are those with gravy. Puncture holes with an ice pick and the seeping gravy will call catfish like a dinner bell. Dry dog food works well for chumming, too.

This secret bait comes to me from a small corner of Arkansas and has proven to pull in large blue catfish averaging 35 pounds from the Sulphur River. This requires taking a 2.5 gallon bucket to the butcher (or slaughterhouse if there is one in your area) to fill with cow’s blood. Once it settles, the blood coagulates into a gelatinous-type consistency. Working well in rivers, lakes and ponds, this bait proves most successful for night fishing by the bank. In the daytime, brim will quickly eat your bait. To use: Grab small chunks (about 1-inch thick), and put into light netting or pantyhose to hold it together. Secure at the top with a knot or twist-tie. Thread onto your hook.6. Garlic and Chicken Skin The fatty, greasy skin of chicken is a feast for catfish. This bait works best to catch smaller channel cats and eating-size catfish because there is not enough blood to attract larger fish. The tough chicken skin stays well on the hook. Chicken skin attracts more fish in warmer water – most likely because warm water allows oils to secrete from the skin. To use: Soak chicken skin overnight in garlic or in chicken livers to intensify the flavor. Chicken skin can also be used as a wrap around pieces of chicken livers. Warming the skins in the microwave before you use it as bait extracts the oils, which will offer a scent trail.7. Ivory Soap If you fish for catfish often, you have likely heard of soap being used as bait at some point. While this “secret” is out, it has taken anglers years of refining — a.k.a. lots of all-or-nothing days on the water — to figure out which soaps work best. The reason as to exactly why catfish are so attracted to soap is still unclear, but it is known to net some very large fish. Many bar soaps have additives and other chemicals that actually deter catfish from going after it. Ivory soap gets high marks for just the right amount of scent. It is a pure soap that has been a secret bait of die-hard cat fishermen for decades. Another successful soap is a Mexican bar soap called Zote. This is also a pure soap, but it contains lard, which attracts catfish like crazy. Soap is a universal winner for all catfish species — they love it. To use: Chunk soap into 1-inch pieces and thread onto your hook. Soap works great for trotlines and it has staying power in the water.8. Booze Many of the best catfish bait recipes involve marinades. While some anglers might tell you their secret recipe, they might not tell you about a key ingredient that is sometimes used to add a little kick to things like liver and raw chicken. The secret? Booze. Certain strong smells like smoke, perfume and other human smells can drive away catfish. But some alcohol can serve as just the right additive to attract them. The secret is adding flavorful alcohol to bait marinades like these tested examples:• Aniseed liquor for bait scenting• Mad Dog 20/20 grape wine to soak raw chicken breast • Beer to marinade salmon steak • Brandy to marinade raw chicken combined with anise oil and cherry and strawberry Jello To use: Alcohol products can be used as marinades or flavor accents to dough balls, night crawlers, raw chicken or other bait.9. Spam The makers of SPAM likely never intended it to be used as catfish bait, but perhaps they missed their marketing niche. SPAM is fantastic bait for large blue, channel and flathead catfish. In 2001, an Arkansas angler named Charles Ashley Jr. set both the state record and world record using SPAM as the bait to catch his 116-pound, 12-ounce blue catfish in the Mississippi River. Ashley’s state record still stands today. Does it work? You bet! SPAM is full of oils that attract fish. You can also use it with cheese cubes for added flavor and scent. The downside to SPAM is that carp love it too, so you have to frequently check your bait. SPAM can be difficult to keep on the hook because of its moist consistency. You can overcome this by keeping it refrigerated or setting it out in the sun to toughen it. To use: Cut SPAM into 1-inch cubes then push onto a treble hook until it feels secure.10. WD-40, Preparation HI cannot say that I have ever turned to household products to enhance my catfish bait, but some anglers swear by WD-40 and Preparation H. There have been healthy discussions over the years as to whether these products really do attract fish, or whether the anglers who have scored with them just got lucky. Isn’t that how most days of fishing go, anyway? WD-40 is often used on fishing equipment to prevent rust. That is likely where the idea of using it for more than rod and reel maintenance came into play. Fishermen started catching fish and believed it was due to the lubricant. Over time, anglers used it because they thought it contained fish oil that attracted the fish. The makers of WD-40 claim that the product does not contain fish oil, nor do they advocate using it for fishing purposes due to a company stance on protecting the environment. Preparation H on the other hand does contain 3% shark liver oil. Both products are still used by anglers who swear these bait additives attract fish, and they have the catch to prove it. To use: Spray dough balls with WD-40 or add a squirt to raw chicken or hot dogs. Preparation H can be added to almost any bait. Load Comments ( 36)Like us on Facebook to stay updated !

       "        {'text': 'Barn Owls by US States …Barn Owls by US States This color-coded map outlines the population status of barn owls throughout the United States. Pink: Endangered; these states may have already suffered such losses of barn owls that habitat restoration combined with nest box programs may be necessary to bring back any numbers. Yellow: Species of Special Concern; these states have seen declining populations. They are excellent states for conservation oriented nest box erection programs in areas of good barn owl habitat. Light Blue: Fair populations; these states offer excellent opportunities to establish robust populations of barn owls for natural rodent control and integrated pest management. Dark Blue: Good populations; these states have such high populations of barn owls that nest boxes are inhabited relatively quickly and occupied at relatively high rates. In such states, barn owls will tend to have more than one brood per year. Excellent states to use barn owls in sophisticated rodent control programs. There are several things to keep in mind while looking at a range map such as the one above. Even in states that show rare or low populations of barn owls, there may be pockets of populations. Ohio is an excellent example where certain counties have fair numbers. It is these populations that can be expanded through nest box programs. Also, some states that have suffered declines may have increasing populations of barn owls due to habitat restoration, such as Pennsylvania where the Pennsylvania State Game Commission is reestablishing many acres of wild grasslands throughout the state. Again, nest box programs in such states are encouraged by wildlife officials. In states that show medium to high populations of barn owls, take into account barn owl preferred habitat. Barn owls do not inhabit forests or most cities. For an example, click on the link under the state of Washington below for a typical pattern of barn owl range in a mountainous state. Keep in mind that the barn owl is likely more common than suspected in most areas. It is a highly secretive bird, and unlike other owls, calls infrequently except in breeding season. Also keep in mind that barn owl range is very dynamic due to the strong dispersal instinct in the young that disperse for up to hundreds of miles in all directions. Northern young tend to go south, but not strictly—plenty go east, west, and north. This means that those areas in need of bolstering populations receive dispersing barn owls on a regular basis, and if proper habitat has been restored with nesting sites, there is a good chance those barn owls will try to populate those areas. For more specific information, find your state below. Some of the states have links to detailed range maps. Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming Alabama Barn Owls – Common throughout the state, recorded in all 67 counties. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources website page on barn owls is here: https://www.outdooralabama.com/watchable-wildlife/what/Birds/owls/bo.cfm Alaska Barn Owls – Barn owls do not occur in Alaska. Arizona Barn Owls – Common throughout the state, especially in agricultural areas. Rare or absent in the high mountains and forested areas. A link to Arizona Sonora Desert Museum is here www.desertmuseum.org/visit/rff_barnowl.php. Arkansas Barn Owls – It is probably more common than thought since few population studies have been done. Strong pockets of barn owls are found in various areas of the state, making it an excellent candidate for barn owl nest box projects. Researcher David Clark is asking people to report known barn owl roosts in Northwest Arkansas. He can be contacted at (501) 590-9559 or by e-mail at dwclark@ualr.edu California Barn Owls – Very common throughout except forests and mountains above 4000 feet. One of the most progressive states in terms of using barn owls for rodent control, California orchards and vineyards have been using them for integrated pest management for decades. An excellent site on using barn owls in vineyards for natural rodent control is here http://tommy51.tripod.com/aboutbarnowls.html Colorado Barn Owls – Numerous, especially the front range, eastern farmlands, and western agricultural areas. A page from the Colorado Department of Natural Resources is here: http://wildlife.state.co.us/Pages/Home.aspx Connecticut Barn Owls – Endangered, partly because grasslands and farmlands have declined; however decent populations exist along the coast and in the large river valleys. Access Connecticut info and range map here: http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?q=325962 . Connecticut’s Department of Environmental Protection encourages residents to erect nest boxes to help bolster the states populations. There is a monitoring and nest box program near Middletown. Delaware Barn Owls – Good populations around Delaware Bay, along the river valleys and in agricultural areas. Access an article here http://www.owlpages.com/news.php?article=574Florida Barn Owls – Common throughout. Highly abundant in agricultural areas, especially sugar cane where sugar companies have been using barn owls for controlling cotton rats and roof rats. An excellent article from CNN about barn owls and sugar cane is here: http://edition.cnn.com/EARTH/9706/10/owls/Georgia Barn Owls – Common throughout. The site for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources is here: http://georgiawildlife.dnr.state.ga.us/content/displaycontent.asp?txt Document=106Hawaii Barn Owls – The common barn owl, Tyto alba, was introduced into Hawaii in 1958. Its numbers are excellent, especially around sugar cane farms. Idaho Barn Owls – Widespread across the southwestern region, rare in the northern mountains but good populations in the Snake River and Clearwater Canyons. Common everywhere except the mountains and forests. Palouse Audubon Society has a good barn owl page here: http://www.palouseaudubon.org Illinois Barn Owls – Endangered. A permanent resident in the south. A rare permanent resident in north and central. Illinois is one of those states that has been working diligently to bolster barn owl populations–and succeeding–by erecting nest boxes in prime habitat. At one point, only four reported incidences of barn owls were reported to be using nest boxes in state (however one of these pairs raised five broods in 23 months!) Since beginning their nest box program, Illinois Department of Natural Resources reports over 25 nesting pairs and growing. The barn owl page at the Illinois Raptor Center is here: http://www.illinoisraptorcenter.org/Field%20Guide/barnowl.html Indiana Barn Owls – The conversion of grasslands and wetlands and the cutting of hedgerows and windbreaks for intensive agriculture have contributed to severe declines in this owl that likely was quite common once, particularly in the southern half of the state. State agencies have erected over 200 boxes in recent years with some success and putting up a box in Indiana is an excellent conservation move. The barn owl page on the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is here: http://www.in.gov/dnr/fishwild/3382.htm Iowa Barn Owls – Endangered. More common in southern half of state. Iowa Department of Natural Resources encourages nest box erection and has been trying for a decade to bolster numbers. Numbers down due to changes in farming: fewer hay and livestock operations, dead hollow trees removed for farming, and metal barns replacing old wooden barns. Excellent article here: http://www.iowabarnfoundation.org/magazine/barn_owls_and_barns.htm Kansas Barn Owls – Common throughout the state; more populous in the western half. Immense amounts of crop and grassland, including soy, wheat, alfalfa, and dairy as well as tracts of old prairie support good populations. The often tree-less landscape however produces a dearth of nesting sites. Nest boxes would likely be used to a high degree and help bolster populations. The Raptors Roost site: http://www.gpnc.org/owlbarn.htm Kentucky Barn Owls – The barn owl has declined in Kentucky, and the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources encourages property owners to erect nest boxes. The department has been conducting its own nest box programs with good success and asks residents to report barn owl nesting. Their barn owl page is here: http://fw.ky.gov/navigation.aspx?cid=631&Nav Path=C100C366Louisiana Barn Owls – Very common in coastal marshes, agricultural regions, and open woods. Researchers have found that the rice rat made up over 97% of the prey items in Louisiana marshes. This would lend credibility to the use of barn owls for helping to control these rodents that cause a great deal of economic loss to rice farms in that state and others. Maine Barn Owls – Rare if not nonexistent. Maine is simply too far north and receives too many deep snows that keep barn owls from surviving the winters. Maryland Barn Owls – Locally common in agricultural areas throughout most of the state. Almost non-existent in the mountainous far western counties, but with excellent concentrations in central and coastal areas. Maryland Cooperative Extension web page on barn owls is here: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/wildlife/Habitat/Wild Acres/wabarnowl.asp Massachusetts Barn Owls – Over 100 barn owls lived on the island of Nantucket at one point. The barn owl most likely goes through boom and bust in the state, depending on the severity of winters. Nest box programs have been conducted with success. A good article is located here: http://www.owlpages.com/news.php?article=77 . Although recorded throughout the state, it is found mainly along the coastal plain from Newburyport south to Cape Cod and the surrounding islands. It also occurs regularly in the Connecticut and Housatonic River Valleys. There is another good article here: http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dfg/nhesp/species-and-conservation/nhfacts/tyto-alba.pdf Michigan Barn Owls – Declined due to loss of habitat, however state programs are helping, and the state encourages the erection of nest boxes. The conversion of most agricultural systems from pasture-based to intensive row crop along with rodenticides have played a significant role in the population decline. Barn owls should benefit from programs like the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that preserve open grassy areas and crop rotations that include a fallow period. An interesting article, which illustrates just how barn owls can be found in states where they are thought not to exist can be found in this article: Michigan Barn Owl Minnesota Barn Owls – Although there are only a few verified records from the state, chances are that the barn owl was once more common in the southern half. Severe winter weather combined with habitat loss has likely contributed to a statewide scarcity. Mississippi Barn Owls – Excellent populations exist throughout the state in areas that are not forested, although good numbers also live along the edges of open woodlands. High numbers exist in the lowlands where grain and cotton provide plenty of rodents. A link to Mississippi Wildlife Rehabilitation Inc. is here: www.mswildliferehab.org/Animal Stories/Barn Owls.htm Missouri Barn Owls – The bird is considered rare in most areas of the state, however the Missouri Department of Conservation encourages the erection of nest boxes. In recent years, Missouri’s DNR has been using barn owl boxes from our company to bolster populations there, fashioning their program after that run by the DNR of Illinois. We expect to see a gradual increase in nesting pairs. If you live in Missouri and would like to help the barn owl population by erecting nest boxes, please call the Missouri Department of Natural Resources to let them know the location of your nest box. Montana Barn Owls – Good populations in the lower elevations from Kalispell in the Central North down through the southern third of the state. The site for the Montana Natural Heritage Program with a range map is here: http://fieldguide.mt.gov/detail_ABNSA01010.aspx Nebraska Barn Owls – Barn owls nest throughout the state, with a high concentration in the southwestern counties. The site for Raptor Recovery Nebraska is here: http://www.raptorrecoverynebr.org/Nevada Barn Owls – Fairly common to common in lower elevation valleys, foothills, and river systems where they inhabit oak savannah and nest in buildings, cavities in cliffs, and hollow trees. Haystacks in Nevada often harbor high concentrations of barn owls which sometimes nest as little as five feet apart. Rehabbers are kept quite busy as hay is loaded onto trucks bound for California, revealing growing broods of owls. New Hampshire Barn Owls – Almost no information is available on the status of barn owls in New Hampshire. Chances are that the bird is rare in most of the state and that there may be a number along the coast in the southern portion. New Jersey Barn Owls – Once common throughout the state’s rural areas, populations have plummeted where once productive farmland has been converted to tract housing and development. Good populations still exist along marshes that border the Delaware River in the southern counties. The site of the New Jersey Raptor Trust is here: http://theraptortrust.org/the-birds/owl-facts/barn-owl/New Mexico Barn Owls – Common throughout except forests and high mountains. A site with some information is here: http://www.enchantment.coop/features/200810.php New York Barn Owls – The New York National Heritage Program (website http://www.acris.nynhp.org/guide.php?id=6941 ) reports that barn owls have declined in New York, but have good populations in at least three areas: Staten Island, Kennedy Airport, and Long Island around Oyster Bay. Nest box programs would likely benefit the barn owl in other areas of the state, particularly the southern and western portions. North Carolina Barn Owls – Once excellent, populations have shown a recent decline. Many of the young barn owls from the north winter in the Carolinas and some eventually settle there. Good habitat is common throughout the state except for the far western mountainous areas. A link to the Carolina Raptor Center is here Carolina Raptor Center North Dakota Barn Owls – Rare or non-existent. This is the northern limit of the barn owl’s range due to severe winters. Ohio Barn Owls – Although the population has declined, there are several areas where barn owls are currently found. This is an excellent state for nest box programs since certain counties have confirmed populations. State biologists report that many barn owls can be found on Amish farms due to the presence of hayfields, horses, and hedgerows. Ohio Department of Natural Resources barn owl page is here: www.ohiodnr.gov/Home/species_a_to_z/Species Guide Index/barnowl/tabid/6545/Default.aspx Oklahoma Barn Owls – Although the barn owl is common in many rural areas, there has been a decline. Researcher Stephen Sheffield suggests that this is due to a scarcity of nesting and roosting sites since surveys have shown that their prey have remained abundant from year to year. The Barn Owl Nest Box project has been erecting nest boxes and finding that they are attracting owls successfully. An article about one nest box project is here: http://www.psoklahoma.com/News/releases/viewrelease.asp?release ID=65Oregon Barn Owls – As in Washington, barn owls are common along the coast in non-forested areas and throughout the agricultural valleys. Oregon vineyards and orchards are using barn owls for rodent control. An excellent article about the use of barn owls for rodent control in Oregon is here: Using Barn Owls for Rodent Control in the Willamette Valley Pennsylvania Barn Owls – Although populations have declined severely, the Pennsylvania State Game Commission has been conducted a grassland habitat restoration program which will undoubtedly help numerous field species. A game commission survey of barn owls has revealed more than previously suspected, and it is likely that barn owls will be increasing due to these conservation efforts and nest box programs instituted by non-profits such as Moraine Preservation Fund. The Pennsylvania Game Commission’s website has an excellent page on their Barn Owl Conservation Initiative and who to contact in the state if you have located any barn owls. Rhode Island Barn Owls – Endangered. Likely to be more common along the coast and river valleys. South Carolina Barn Owls – There once were excellent populations in the entire state except for the extreme western corner. In recent decades, populations have declined, especially in the Piedmont. Much more common along the coast. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has been erecting nest boxes in good habitat. They have a good site on grassland species here: http://www.dnr.sc.gov/cwcs/pdf/Grasslandbirds.pdf South Dakota Barn Owls – Uncommon. Known barn owl nest sites are scattered and few in number. Although documented from as far west as Fall River County, most nests have been found in natural cavities in banks of the Missouri River’s reservoirs and adjacent drainages. Not much is known about the true distribution or abundance of South Dakota’s nesting barn owls. The barn owl has been known to excavate sites in soft substrate in the Sand Hills. The website of the South Dakota Natural Heritage Program encourages the erection of nest boxes. Tennessee Barn Owls – More common in the central and eastern portions. The population of barn owls may be declining as farmlands, with their open grassland habitats such as hayfields and pastures, disappear. In Tennessee, the barn owl has been designated as a species in need of management. An excellent state for conservation measures such as habitat preservation and nest box installation. State biologist Scott Somershoe has been organizing barn owl nest box construction. Call 615-862-4187. Several other biologists are working to install nest boxes in prime habitat.http://www.tnwatchablewildlife.org/details.cfm?displayhabitat=grassland&sort=aounumber&typename=GRASSLAND%20AND%20SHRUB&uid=09041919141752583&commonname=Barn%20Owl Texas Barn Owls – Common throughout Texas. A good number of farms and ranches have erected nest boxes with excellent results. A newspaper article on Texas barn owls is here: www.lubbockonline.com/stories/102608/col_348426055Utah Barn Owls – Common throughout except forests. Plenty of good studies have been done in Utah, revealing a good population, some records of fall nesting, and burrowing in riverbanks for nest holes. Utah Department of Natural Resources barn owl page: http://www.dwrcdc.nr.utah.gov/rsgis2/search/Display.asp? Fl Nm=tytoalba Vermont Barn Owls – Rare. In the 1985 Breeding Bird Atlas, four pairs were documented. As in Maine, the severe winters limit populations. Virginia Barn Owls – Common on the coastal plain and very robust populations along the coast and Chesapeake Bay. Rare in the mountainous western edge of the state. Good concentrations in the Shenandoah Valley. Researchers there report that old silos are a frequent nesting site and that barn owls actually burrow hollows in the old silage to lay their eggs and raise their chicks. Washington Barn Owls – Common permanent residents in the lower, unforested areas of the state, namely along the coast, in the eastern lowlands, the Columbia Valley, and most of western Washington. High concentrations in Puget Sound and the Columbia Valley. They are being used for rodent control by vineyards and orchards. For an excellent range map visit http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/bird/barn_owl. Bird Web West Virginia Barn Owls – Common in agricultural and open grassy areas, but nonexistent in the forested mountains. They apparently have been increasing, in part due to a nest box program. Also, abandoned strip mines turned to grasslands have increased populations, although these lands could well benefit from nest box installation. You can access a good article here that gives phone numbers of state biologists interested in increasing populations: http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1011&dat=20010830&id=Uzcl AAAAIBAJ&sjid=dx EGAAAAIBAJ&pg=759,279940Wisconsin Barn Owls – Endangered. Barn owls generally live only in the southern third of the state. Although Wisconsin’s barn-owl population was never high, a decrease in sightings since the 1950s suggests that it has been declining. Barn owls were placed on the Wisconsin Endangered Species List in 1979. At present, the status of the population in Wisconsin is unknown. Found in small numbers north to Polk, Clark, Vilas and Marinette counties, which is the edge of their northern range in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Bird Conservation Initiative has a good site and a range map here: http://www.wisconsinbirds.org/plan/species/bnow.htm Wyoming Barn Owls – Common throughout the state except in forests. Often nests in abandoned mines, sometimes nesting as far as one hundred feet below the surface. ', 'score': '-6.49823'}],\n",
